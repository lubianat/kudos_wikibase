It appears to be more of paid enthusiasm rather than strategic allocation. There are no mandatory guidelines for the breweries regarding what needs to be brewed; they are encouraged to brew the IPA but not required. There is also no commitment beyond the initial run. The only commitment seems to be the production of 500 cans of beer at a cost of $9 per can, while the actual production cost is no more than $1.5-2. Additionally, the beer is being sold by Narcose at a discounted price of $3.33 per can, resulting in a possible 8x markup on COGs, which is unheard of in the industry.  As someone with beverage companies, I would have preferred to see a consolidation of the number of breweries, with a greater allocation of funds to each. Sourcing brewers who specialize in certain styles, funding them for the creation of custom recipes for the Public Good portfolio. Such an approach would result in a world-class CC0 beer range while still achieving expansion."

We do not own a brewery or food business, but we have more than 20 years of experience in marketing, branding, and international business.  The commitment is to produce Public Good Beer, not to impose standards on a cc0 brand.  The proposal makes it clear that part of the funding will be used for a minimum giveaway of 500 cans. Narcose, for example, has produced 3000 cans of Public Good without any funding. The breweries in the proposal produce this or more per batch.  4500 dollars will be used for label printing, events (probably more than one), a minimum of 500 free beers (our phase 1 was only 300), marketing, activations, and other production costs. There is no such thing as 9 dollars per can.  Our costs are at the end of the proposal.   The team behind Phase 1 has unquestionable skills and experience to execute this proposal for Phase 2. We thank everyone who is trusting us and voting for and invite anyone who might have questions to dm us at @PublicGoodBeer "

Proposal 319,Supported By,0x281ec184e704ce57570614c33b3477ec7ff07243,2.0,"Some context, and a few question answers🙏  Nermans first proposal ( https://nouns.wtf/vote/77 ) was very long, specific, and ambitious. We almost entirely automated governance in Nouncil and completed a variety of out-of-scope features to make sure Nouncils governance ran smoothly. Now, Nouncil is the most active voting member of Nouns DAO, with Nerman automating the 10,000+ votes of over 100 Nouncillors voting on more than 200 Nouns DAO props. We navigated the changing world of Nouns Discords as the official one closed, always building for an expanding decentralized social group. Whenever a good idea arose we implemented further features, like the Nouns Nymz feed. We continued working on the bots, at our own expense, long after the initial proposals end date.  At the end of the process the feature list felt limiting, preventing us from continuously learning and refining our direction according to user interest and DAO priority. For instance, when we wrote this proposal Nouns had an official Discord. Things change fast here.  I also had several people note (semi-joking, semi-serious) that prop 77 was too long of a read. So - this proposal is shorter and focused on a broader vision over a specific time period. This gives us a clear roadmap, as well as the flexibility to learn, grow, and pivot as we work.   The primary focus of this prop is actually the Nounish developer SDK, not a discord bot. `npm install nerman`. The first version of the Nerman.js SDK was essential to all the bots we built and one of the most impactful things delivered.  This proposal is not an extensive documentation of the features we will add. This is a proposal to keep the team focused on the project, working as hard as we can towards the vision specified for 6 months. We are currently a team of three, with me working part time leading, planning, and coding. This proposal does not cover any of my time spent on other Nouns projects - Yitong, you can still expect an ambitious Nouns Short Shorts proposal.  Some of the items here will be very significant to do extensively and correctly. Were not just checking boxes, this library should be the cleanest, most intuitive way of interacting with the Nouniverse. There is easily enough work here for the team to stay busy for 6 months. Each of the features listed is a potential rabbit hole. Properly indexing all Nouns DAO data and coding interesting queries to analyze it, implementing thoughtful connections to all Nouns related projects, implementing all Nounish DAO contracts... these are huge undertakings. On top of that, we intend on responding to an ever changing environment and incorporating new tools and features that pop up as we go. If something is getting traction within Nouns we will try to incorporate it quickly. If the DAO changes significantly, or forks, we will provide connections to all the feeds that need them.  Nerman.js will be the simplest way for developers to integrate Nouns events and data into their projects. For devs who want to use their own tooling, Nerman.js documentation will be the simplest place to learn about Nouns DAO contracts and the technical universe of projects surrounding Nouns."

It feels like the roadmap for purely maintaining bots is limited, and if Joel & team have 3 devs, id encourage them to think about additional ways they can contribute on the tooling front.   2.

Quality. I believe we should be striving to build a very high quality game for Nouns, instead of many throw-away mobile games. From what was shown on the proposal the quality just isnt there, it looks a bit amateurish to be completely honest.  Budget. No clarity on how the funds are going to be used. The figures seem high and arbitrary. Also denominated in ETH which I dont think fits this proposal.  Audience. The proposed website and games feel like a dated model. Im not sure we would see much use of the website at all.  Again, appreciate the proposers but I dont believe this is the right fit for Nouns.  *sent from voter.wtf*"

Atrium is setting up production workflows that are suited to operate in: - A smaller scale budget.  - Remote first coordination workflows. - And unparalleled transparency on the production timeline and process itself.    To address Wilson’s comment about seeing more Nouns in the story:  - We have a lot planned. The story has just started and Nouns will certainly have more than enough screen time of their own alongside Gi (who is also a Noun). Hint - Jaws Hardback isn’t just a mural. “Venture to new worlds, visit other cities!”  To address Hindsight’s comment: - Absolutely important to understand effectiveness of the spend as it further goes down the production timeline. From a content standpoint, Our ultimate goal is to have the movie be seen by a LOT more people through more traditional distribution mechanisms. Those discussions are already underway but nature of the business, slower moving :) . Good thing is, we are literally just a pilot into the world building here and have a solid foundation to now build outwards from! "

Its challenging to see how it can evolve into a self-sustaining venture without a more comprehensive plan.   Right now, it almost feels like a concealed levy intertwined with other proposals, with their success uncertain.   Id prefer to see a proposal that directly supports you in establishing this as an independently viable business or considers funding the LO-FI Noggles as a public good/utility, thereby enabling everyone to access the designs and production capabilities as needed. Otherwise, when is the next request, or the next one, or the next one...  Its absolutely fine to request that event organizers contribute towards the cost of these novel additions to their events.   A little friction can sometimes be necessary and there are instances when its best to eliminate the intermediary, similar to Ethereum.  Recently Ive observed piles of unused stickers from events which left me hesitant for this one, yes even noggle stickers that were not just handed out by randos to randos.  I truly appreciate the LO-FI Noggles and am delighted to see them at a lower production cost, but with what I have seen unused and thrown away from similar items I feel so much apprehension to be a straight hell yeah on this.  I want to reiterate, I would be very much interested in a prop that funded you and nounworks as a viable business that becomes self-sufficient in its operations."

I like them better than the more sturdy plastic ones b/c it feels less wasteful in the mass marketing form (they are made of paper & very flat). so overall Im very supportive of this prop and am voting FOR.  I do feel a bit concerned that a price point of FREE can lead to ppl over asking for these noggles (for example you realistically need only 500 but you ask 1000 b/c why not theres a small chance you might need more and it costs you nothing). So I would be a proponent of charging a small fee, lets say 10 cents per lo-fi noggle. In that case the dao is basically subsidizing the noggles (paying 95% of the $2 cost) but its still not exactly free for the recipient that they likely wont order 2x what they need.  Would love nounsworks team to think through this dynamic before the followup prop but again voting FOR for this."

I believe having the noggles on jerseys is an effective proliferation tool and a way to gain global awareness. Even if its just on a subconscious level we would be exposing the noggles to a huge audience.  That being said I have a few issues with this prop. Mainly I sensed a disconnect from Nouns, it feels a bit like Nouns is being used as a stepping stone. I wouldve liked to see more on how one would collaborate with the other and how the project would incorporate nounish values. Also wouldve been nice to see some engagement from Borna and other players, showing interest in Nouns and in this partnership.

Cozy is a credible-neutrality insurance protocol that we value highly. Similar models have been adopted by Liquity and Aave (...) and have stood the test of the market. For this reason, we are optimistic about Cozys future.  But it offers a crap insurance proposal for nounsdao with grossly unequal risks and benefits to recklessly usurp the time and energy of all governance participants and covertly complete its product seeding user capture plan. This behavior is disgusting to our researcher of the proposal.  Our opposition stems from two main reasons:  1. Cozy currently lacks the capacity to address the issues it claims to solve. Its insurance pool is only $500,000, and its contract has only been deployed for a month, yet it claims to protect $1,000,000 in assets. For policyholders, this presents a garbage product with a severe imbalance of risk and reward.  2. The second reason comes from the opinion of the proposal researcher: I view this proposal as a covert governance attack. The time and energy invested by the Nouns collective in governance is a pure public good, and Cozys blatant consumption of all governance participants time and energy is a Standard hitchhiking behavior. It forced me to spend an hour researching its mechanisms, gathering data, and creating documents to explain to our squad why its proposal is terrible.. If there are too many proposals like Cozys, I wont invest time in researching and debating Nouns proposals anymore, which infuriates me."

Proposal 313,Opposed By,0x3cbd57da2f08b3268da07e5c9038c11861828637,1.0,"My thesis as a delegate is: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”  I agree with the points here that treasury risk management should be handled via the ETH to stETH ratio, not via buying peg protection. I also think that, while this proposal itself is relatively small and low risk, it opens the door to more complicated treasury management techniques.  DAO treasury management is a slippery slope. As soon as opportunities for more yield (or alternatively, further hedges) come up, it begins to consume the DAO. Similar to Wilson’s reasoning, if we buy peg protection, what comes next? This is an example of this slippery slope, where techniques gradually grow more and more complicated. Eventually, the complexity grows to the point where it can threaten the security of the DAO’s treasury. (Not with this proposal, which is quite reasonable and helps the security of the treasury, but only in proposals that go further down the slippery slope.)  We should draw a line at staking ETH in Lido. If we wanted peg protection, holding stablecoins would likely be a better hedge, given how much a catastrophic stETH depeg would impact the price of ETH.  I have a lot of respect for the work that Cozy Finance is doing, and I also believe that an audit of the L1Proxy is likely useful for the industry. But I would prefer that those funding requests are separate from treasury management techniques. I am voting No because the slippery slope of treasury management — as much as I like the specific project, I view it as risky to set a precedent of active treasury management and yield/hedge chasing.  *sent from voter.wtf*"

I do not think the DAO is optimized to make these kinds of risk and yield decisions. If we are concerned about depegs at all, I think we should just hold ETH. I am sympathetic to the point that voting on things like this is not a great use of the DAOs time.   I *do* want to see the DAO support important DeFi work where it can make sense, though. To be honest, I think I would be more open to just doing benevolence grants for co-marketing or something like that, rather than actually using our treasury in DeFi.   My vote on [Proposal 217: Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217) > I think that using the treasury to earn yield is a slippery slope and is a path we should avoid. The treasury should be used to fund Nounish ideas. We should not be seeking 5% yield opportunities but rather opportunities to 10x or 100x the number of people who know of Nouns, 10x or 100x peoples passion for Nouns, 10x or 100x Nounish organizations or creators resources, etc. I see seeking treasury yield through DeFi as a distraction from these other things and think it is outside the DAOs mandate. I also worry that putting the treasury to work earning yield will make people less inclined to spend the treasury when I would prefer something of the upset approach: burn stale treasury ETH past a certain date as an incentive to us it or lose it.  *sent from voter.wtf*"

Regardless, I think this prop is a reasonable exploration and worth funding given its relatively low risk. Even just getting an Optimism proxy itself is worth the price of admission on this one!"

In premise, I generally dont view insurance as a great asset to purchase - if the underwriter is pricing the insurance premium correctly and generating a great return, it necessarily means the buyer is not getting a good return on their premium payments. Conversely, if the underwriter is pricing the insurance premium incorrectly, the buyer may get a good return on their payments, but ultimately runs the risk of counterparty insolvency. In this case, paying over 1% fees sounds cheap until you compound that number for a few years and realize the opportunity cost.  In execution, I find it odd that we first have to pay to get the contract audited. Are cozy contracts not already audited? If not, why is that something we should cover? Its a little rich for us to pay to verify the veracity of the product were aiming to purchase itself. Second, the pool seems to only have $300k left, which is nowhere close to covering our actual stETH exposure of $26M.  If we are serious about risk management and insurance, there are better ways to accomplish the same goals (ie other LSTs, initiating short perp positions, etc). If stETH depegs more than 50%, the entire ecosystem will have bigger problems than waiting on a $300k insurance payout.  *sent from voter.wtf*"

We endorse the plan by Nouns Governo,, which is building a more advanced module architecture for NFT governance. Nouns DAO has consistently been leading the standards of NFT governance, which is one of the reasons we love Nouns.  2. Our only concern is that the development of NounsDAOs core smart contracts relies solely on one team. We hope that more teams will join the exploration of NounsDAOs governance standards in the future. Also, the abstraction of the work makes it difficult for the community to understand its impact. However, this is not a problem of David & Elads. In fact, NounsDAO is very fortunate to be able to work with them."

Regarding communication with the DAO, I watched the ETHDenver talk and found it very helpful. I would encourage creating small videos like this, where team members can explain key features using simple slides. This can effectively communicate important information to everyone in the DAO, including non-coders.  Agreeing with what Wilson said earlier.  Ill take this opportunity to also say that, whether it is code or content, I would be much happier voting for features or deliverables that represent a certain amount of time, rather than voting for open-ended terms or retainer contracts that include deliverables. It is a minor reframing, but I think it helps create better incentives and also dismisses the tendency to make a team seem official. That being said, I am really excited about the Verb teams work, and I am glad they are building those features that can help us scale Nouns and DAOs in general.  Thank you for Streamer and excited about Nouns Governor and the propoasal editing period. Looking forward! "

Proposal 311,Supported By,0xae65e700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dd26f8146c0,3.0,"I heavily agree with all that already has been said (esp what wilson wrote out in detail).  one thing I wanted to add is that I think we should break out of the mold of a single governor. well likely need to keep a single auction house but theres no reason for us to not utilize multiple governors for different purposes. for example, since the historic success of prop 190 weve all known that droposals by the dao are a thing that can really work. it can be meaningful monetization for the public art created for both the artist and the dao and doesnt hinder the cc0 / all-public-access nature of the artwork while also allowing the dao to define what it views as canonical. amazing. we love that. HOWEVER, we havent been able to really utilize droposals at an internet pace well yet b/c the two week process of getting a prop onchain and then it getting through just breaks the whole vibe. but there is no reason that the droposal props need two weeks worth of rigor. it doesnt ask for funding. it doesnt change the smart contracts. it should be a separate governor that has lets say a 30% threshold (or whatever we think is enough to make something canon) and whenever that threshold is met the droposal goes through and nouns provenance stamp lands on the OE mint. that should be possible on a moments notice as long as enough voters agree.  once we break out of the idea of a single governor then a number of these bottleneck issues or code base capture issues that have been raised can also be lessoned. different teams can be working on different governors. we can also just try something that would otherwise feel impossibly contentious. like once private voting is ready, we probably shouldnt argue about whether the main governor should adopt it. we should just deploy a governor with private voting, send a minimal amount of dao funds to it, then see what that experience is like!  of course there should be commonalities between governors. if the verbs team builds out the NFT-first nouns governor as they propose here, then it would be best for everyone to share that base (and fork from there) so that the governance clients can easily support the multiple governors. but I think increasingly the real value prop of the verbs team might be in defining that base and evolving that base where a lot of experimentation can still occur by other teams from all the forks that serve different functions / experiments. excited for a multi governor world for nouns!

Proposal 311,Supported By,0xbc3ed6b537f2980e66f396fe14210a56ba3f72c4,2.0,"Am excited to vote FOR this proposal, and want to use my vote to flesh out some of my thinking on the topic of how I think about developing the DAO, code-wise.  I would prefer that Nouns onchain code changes are driven in two ways: 1. The DAO decides that it wants to make some changes, and then solicits quotes or runs a prop house for ideas on how to implement the change.  2. Teams make direct proposals to the DAO on code changes *they* think should be made, and the DAO funds them to work on it.   In either case, I think the DAO should be driving changes and should generally be voting on a per feature basis.   I dislike funding teams in an open ended way for a few reasons 1. I think it becomes unclear to outsiders what is and isnt being worked on, and how they can get involved. Anything important to the DAO will be taken on by a funded team with an open mandate. Which in a way is great: talented people are ready to work on stuff! But I also think can feel like capture of the codebase.   2. I am not sure how much the DAO code should be changing, and on what frequency. If teams are funded to work on stuff, they’ll find stuff to do, but it’s not guaranteed that the DAO would vote to have each of those things worked on, if it was up to them.  3. Finally, it often ends up that features get bundled together in updates, and it makes it hard for DAO members to make voting decisions.   That all said, there are practicalities at play. Most good devs want some stability. They do not want to need to get funding feature to feature. And also, due to the nature of how smart contracts are developed, it is efficient to bundle things into a single audit.   So, to the case at hand. With Verbs we have great devs, who have been with Nouns nearly since the start, and have done great work. The pay is high, but is on par for staff engineer levels of salary + equity, and I think high pay is to be expected for the uncertain nature of this job (will you get funded again in six months?) and the lack of things like health benefits.   I read this proposal and think it mostly falls in category (2) above—“Teams make direct proposals to the DAO on code changes *they* think should be made, and the DAO funds them to work on it.” I think an NFT-first governor is important, I think seeing through the Fork is important, tips to governance clients, undo votes, and price oracle would be nice to have!  So, I think we have a good thing going and I think it makes sense to fund the development of the work proposed. I know Verbs team is highly interested in figuring out the best way to develop the DAO, so I look forward to working with them to figure this all out!   As a small practical suggestion, I wonder if we could start the practice of allowing the DAO to vote on each feature included in an audit, and possibly even just reserve an audit slot every six months that many teams can get code into?

The channel is getting some good views and seems to be earning ad revenue on its own. The goal is to get 15 monetized videos to get to sustainability, and the channel already has 8 and has recently been releasing more than 1 per week! Given these factors, I dont think the ask for $60k makes sense. And even without these factors, I do not think I would support such a large ask for this sort of sing along type content.   I might support a lower ask, or funding more more unique, high touch content. Like videos with story lines. Perhaps some funding with an ad revenue split could be interesting, but gets a bit sticky to try to figure that out/prove revenues, etc.    Wish you good luck and am glad the channel is seeing success!   *sent from voter.wtf*"

This is especially true among groups that historically have viewed crypto negatively and should have an introduction to it in a positive light.  The prop doesn’t specify whether the commissions themselves will also be CC0, and instead talks about the artists being introduced to CC0 work. 100 CC0 commissions would be nice as a base for the Nouns community to build on top of!

I am voting `Against` however because I think in context of the large requested sum of `100 ETH`, Nouns DAO should normalize going though Discourse discussion process to flesh things out, as per the docs. This will encourage thoughtful applications of capital, esp. where the proposed funding seems more remotely related to Nouns` brand and purpose. Further, given the grant already given to Protocol Guild (500 ETH), this would seem to overlap and open Nouns up to many such requests on top of its existing, demonstrated commitment to ETH protocol support and public goods. Nouns should insulate itself from political and legal risk through things like PG curation. All this being said, 100 ETH seems fair to cover dev support for next year, as the 10 ETH monthly donation team already has can cover stated infra costs."

A proposal like this serves as a press release, a piece of history, and the story we tell lasts far longer than the ETH we donate.

Proposal 304,Abstained By,0x3cbd57da2f08b3268da07e5c9038c11861828637,1.0,"My thesis as a delegate is: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”  I am strongly in favor of this proposal. Ethereum’s core values include censorship resistance, and that is something very few groups are willing to fund. Ensuring that MEV relayers are neutral is key as more and more organizations consolidate on a small number of relayers.  In addition, Ultra Round Relay is a good example of something that other organizations won’t fund. Nouns is the perfect group in the ecosystem to fund this.  One detail of the prop that I would have liked to see is some kind of promotion that Ultra Sound Relay gives Nouns. This could range from a simple “Sponsored by Nouns ⌐◨-◨” to something fun, like special callouts for blocks with Nouns Graffiti. The prop points to goodwill and attention generated by these donations, which is true but attention is often brief. I’d love to see something more ongoing in collaboration with Ultra Sound Relay. Given that Noun 40 has been in communication with the Ultra Sound Relay team, I don’t see this as necessary in the prop, but it would be nice to follow up when the prop is completed. This kind of promotion is a way to continue to attract people with Ethereum’s values to Nouns, and it is important for ideological alignment.  One important note: Given the liability considerations around OFAC, I am voting “Abstain” rather than “For.” DAOs badly need solutions to limit liability for voters, but the aggressive interpretation taken by regulators makes it harder to take this risk. Allowing voters to freely express speech without significant concerns for the liability surrounding those actions is important, and something I’ve been personally researching and would love to bring to Nouns. While I continue this research, I will vote “Abstain.” I sincerely hope that we can figure out approaches that would allow me to freely vote “For.”"

Im a fan of the whole ultrasound money site + relayer, but im trying to understand why our eth donation makes sense here. it seems like its just a random donation, without any benefits to the nouns ecosystem, nor is it as if the core team asked for it. Im generally in favor of supporting public goods software, but this seems like its just a one time payment for nothing in return. It’s not that I don’t support “goodwill”, it’s just that I’m not sure how one measures that, which makes it hard to justify. By the above logic, why not donate 500E or 1000E? Or why not send 100E to vitalik for all of his contributions to public goods?  Part of the appeal of a dao to me is to be able to coordinate groups of ppl to do things they couldn’t normally do individually- when it comes to things like pure donations, its not clear to me why people couldn’t just donate to the specific causes in the specific amounts they prefer.  Theres a maxim Price is what you pay, value is what you get. My concern with props where we are giving back to the ecosystem without any detail or plan is that if feels like blanket spend based on the hope that it ends up being valuable in some nebulous way.  Theres nothing wrong with funding ideas with potentially high but unclear value, but that becomes a slippery slope to spending increasing amts b/c theres no way to measure the upside anyways.  Should the ultrasound team have approached us for some kind of funding (sponsorship, or funding some new project, etc) I would be in support of that, but as a matter of principle I dont think I am in favor of just giving something away.  At this point in the vote it looks clear to pass, and Im happy to disagree and commit, but I still want to memorialize my reasoning on chain as a reference for future votes. "

Prop 224 was intended to market the Nouns auction and increase prices. I think we stand to benefit from explicitly approaching this. Lets try to actually learn some lessons in the grand virtuous cycle experiment.  In the previous prop past art was referenced as selling for more than 250k, yet the pieces from Prop 224 did not raise auction prices by anywhere close to that. We did not move the needle on auction prices as planned, there was a disconnect.  But - they did a few things right. They raised auction prices in a way that was clearly attributed to their efforts, meaning they effectively caught peoples attention and converted this into bids, proving that the approach is a possibility. They earned genuine enthusiasm from a number of Nouners during the week, I enjoyed their posts on twitter, the events they held, and this video: https://vimeo.com/829178232.  I think it makes sense to readjust and try again, and they have. This proposal offers 1001 physical pieces at a significantly lower per-piece cost to the DAO. On top of this, and most importantly, this is paired with 10 months of marketing, comms, and events.   I am in favour of this proposal. For it to be considered a success, and receive further funding, we need to see a sustained increase in average auction price. If it increases by about 1 ETH over the next 264 days we break even.  If this passes I hope the team puts serious effort into drawing attention to their art and the daily Nouns auction. I expect to see buzz on Twitter and other socials celebrating the Noun of the day."

Would it be better to reject this prop and hope 5oc comes back with another, more polished proposal? Possibly.

I am voting for because I think this could turn into something exciting and I think the flow of funds, starting with funding to build out a proof of concept, makes sense and is a reasonable guard.   It looks like this is not going to pass, so Ill just note some ideas - Could we first fund an exploration to build a proof of concept machine? I think people will be excited by some proof they can see.  - Are we sure that going for a validator is the best simplification of the original prop (281)? I really liked the original props focus on hobbyists and learning. This feels Nounish. Is there a way we can push in this direction at a lower cost? Again, just a proof of concept people can get excited about?  - Nounish design is cool, but where can we gain the most from your expertise? Are there any huge pain points we can solve since well be going 0 to 1? It feels like a lot of the work for a validator may be redundant?  - In general, Id say dont hesitate to discuss with any and all Nouners to find the most exciting version of this, and then make sure to pitch that here. E.g. for this prop I think this may have amounted to one of the cheaaper validator options on the market, but this aspect wasnt really pitched.

Its great! Theres an overwhelming amount of Nouns art on here and communicates a broad sense of Nouns and Nounish aesthetic. Its currently my 2nd favorite reference to send artists for research, second only to the actual Nouns DAO playground.  If Nouns is going to last forever, shouldnt we be archiving everything?  I would be happy to fund this as is, but it doesnt look like it will pass. In the next iteration of this prop I would like to see the following:  1. A continued focus on CC0. The art is all interesting, mostly for skimming though. I can actually use the CC0 content! I can put it in videos, art, put it on a shirt. The more this focuses on CC0 media the more it enables and encourages viral permissionless growth of Nouns.  2. The Nouns DAO on-chain proposals section needs to be fleshed out more, and could also be a serious justification for this project. Each funded DAO proposal should have a ton of meta-media. Behind the scenes shots, interviews with the proposer, images from the on-chain prop, screenshots and screen recordings of anything digital. Currently most props have 1-4 images and it doesnt feel comprehensive. Work with the prop submitters and teams to really get a thorough pile of media from them.  3. Better top-level organization of content. I dont really understand the difference between NOUNS SPECIAL and NOUNS WORLD and NOUNS on the front page - it should be way more intuitive. Each item on the front page needs to be essential and obvious.  4. This prop is probably too focused on the design and tech. It looks beautiful, and the arweave uploader is cool, but I think the focus really needs to be on usability, figuring out exactly what needs this fulfills, and on the content itself.

First and foremost I love the focus on defining what you want Nouns to mean. The culture, values, and general vibe. Positivity, health, organic local community growth. This all feels very wholesome and I like the effort here. I chuckled at the R in FRENS: Refrain from promoting your project or business. Lol.  You already have existing clubs, youre already running. Thousands of cumulative KM run is an excellent success metric. Adding some Nounish swag makes a lot of sense to me.  To Noun 12s point - I think an interesting path forward is for these running clubs to remain self-sustaining groups that continue to exist regardless of Nouns funding. That means not depending on Nouns funding for general operations, instead just focusing DAO bucks specifically on Nouns proliferation. Something to think about when starting new groups. These clubs are much more valuable to us if they arent temporary and plan to exist with or without further funding.  My main request: more cell phone running videos! More Noggle-y running montages!"

Pairing this with conferences is a smart way to focus on a crypto segment, while non-conference related running clubs can bring new people in who may be new to Nouns.

I know there was some pushback on this ROI point: a Noun was sold due to last years activation! I really like framing returns in terms of bringing in Noun buyers, so I appreciate this. But I am not totally sure how to measure: is the return just the value of that auction? Is it the surplus value vs. the trailing average auction? Or something else?   Even if we say the return should be counted as the total auction value, I feel compelled to stick with my feeling that spending on event sponsorships is not a good use of funds right now. It seems like there is an amazing Nouns community in Brazil and I would love to fund some crazy and fun stuff, perhaps like doubling down on the momentum around the Nounstacle?  Thanks again to the proposers! I hope my vote doesnt discourage their enthusiasm for Nouns. "

Proposal 295,Opposed By,0xe412186a1865c4fe54a79e0adcb08b81233df674,2.0,"Prop #285 revealed some communication and consistency issues from this team, and as a result, I do not feel comfortable funding this. Comments from the previous prop pasted below.   ——  I’m voting against this prop. This conference seems pretty generic as far as NFT/ tech conferences go and I question how much value Nouns will get out of a sponsored presence. That being said, communication from the conference and proposing team has been *inconsistent* at best.   One of the biggest issues I noticed was 1/3 of the prop money ($30k) would go to a conference “sponsorship” and I still can’t figure out what we would get for that sponsorship.   In the conference brochure there isn’t a $30k sponsorship package listed, although the team claims they were able to negotiate with “inner web3 circle” for a better deal.   The sponsorship packages listed in the provided brochure are: $12k, $20k, $40k, $80k, and $200k. So what do we get for our $30k sponsorship exactly? One member of the team mentioned they negotiated the $80k package down to $30k, another member said we are getting the $200k package for $30k. I’m still left trying to figure out what we get for a $30k sponsorship and how can we verify this?    I requested that the team provide an invoice or some documentation of this $30k sponsorship package and what comes with it, but as of this vote I have not received this.   There are also inconsistent metrics cited for expected number of attendees. In the prop text, the proposing team claims 30,000 attendees are expected, but then in provided conference graphics the claim is 40,000 attendees are expected.   I think there is enough inconsistency in statements from the team, provided graphics, and plans for spending our investment that we should not grant these funds."

In the event that we do need to halt funding to a project, milestone dates provide specific moments where the DAO can focus attention on evaluating proposal outcomes. This also adds incentive for proposers to create reasonable timelines and goals that they need to hit. I am supportive of development in this area.  This proposal is to retrofund an audit by 0xMacro and cover deployment costs. In general I think this is reasonable ask, however in proposal discussions further serious issues were found with the code. The audit clearly states this audit should not solely be relied upon for security. Suddenly covering the audit costs becomes less compelling.  So what are we supposed to do? What should we rely on for security? Multiple audits? Code4rena? Is there a way to formalize and decentralize how we approach both DAO upgrades and contract interactions?   I am abstaining on this one."

This proposal misses the mark by focusing on promotion and advertising so early on. We shouldn’t spend on ads before growing organically. When communities are new and delicate, they should grow slowly before trying to ramp up. Any localized version of Nouns will inherently be fragile at the start, if it is seeking to build a strong community.  I would support a proposal only for translation, which is a small fraction of the requested budget. I don’t support marketing before this takes place for a long time. Ad spend is the wrong way to grow Nouns and misses the mark. Let’s help people around the world understand Nouns first, and they will find us when they align with the mission."

This one is more unique, since it focuses on the “gathering place” part of the thesis.  Explaining what Nouns does is extremely important. Even within Nouns, there are differing visions of the goal: A space for public goods? A meme to proliferate? A treasury that should focus on growth? When Nouns itself has so many different visions, it becomes especially important to synthesize and explain those visions to the world.  As someone who’s worked on explaining complex spaces like DAOs from scratch, I know that this is really, really hard. Getting the messaging right, finding the right balance between simplicity and nuance, and then getting the content out into the world takes a long time. It’s a full-time job, and not one that is easy to decentralize. Just like how crypto startups shouldn’t decentralize before they have product-market fit, crypto media shouldn’t decentralize before they have “narrative-market fit”.  I understand the desire to decentralize. I understand the concern about reach. I understand the hesitation about the size of the ask. But the reality is that, in my opinion, it’s too early for those things. Nouns needs to figure out how to tell its story, and frankly it’s not very good at it right now. Before we add many narratives and styles into the mix — which we should! — we should try to get one right.  Let’s see what Nounish produces, give them time to accomplish the huge task in front of them, and then fund even more voices. Their content is easy to discover and remix — that is already a foundation for others to build on top of. The decentralization and reach will come in due time. It took half a decade for people to begin to understand what a DAO was. And then suddenly, it clicked for people all at once. Nouns is on a similar journey. Let’s give Nounish the time and resources to grow. This won’t take months. It will take years. Let’s give them the ability to make this happen."

Producing high quality video content is perhaps the most important thing we can do as a community to try and tell our story to people outside that bubble.   The videos Nounish produces are doubly important, because while they reach many people in the moment and beautifully highlight what we are accomplishing as a DAO, these videos are also pieces evergreen content that are being woven together into a net to catch newcomers in the future, no matter how they find out about Nouns to begin with.   If Noggles are featured in a SuperBowl commercial and there is no “net” of engaging Nounish content to catch the resulting eyeballs, did it even make a sound?   Finally, all of Nounish’s content is CC0 and as a result, it is routinely remixed and reused, like a multimedia embodiment of Nouns itself.

Before buying a Noun, the content from Nounish was probably what impressed me most about the project. I really feel they are exceptionally good at what they do, and we are lucky to have them.   As I think weve seen with the recent video contest, even with huge prizes, it is hard to get great content and it requires a good amount of admin overhead.   I think the DAO funding competent, self-directed teams is an efficiency win and makes sense. Sometimes the most efficient decentralization is empowering several centralized teams!  I absolutely open to funding other teams or organizing our spending through different means: prop house or whatever. But telling our story is very important--both externally as well as internally--and I dont think we should stop funding this while we wait to figure something else out. If we have an abundance of good storytelling happening, then we can decide how to optimize. The DAO is still in its infancy and it would feel like a huge loss to lose this team right now. I am comfortable spending 4% of the treasury/12% of annualized auction revenues on this.   Finally, Im not sure how much pressure we should put on this team re distribution. I am excited to see what they come up with, but I am also open to the idea that they are great storytellers (and the stories have organic reach, as weve seen!) and we can possibly solve for distribution separately.

As a dadlegate I can’t tell you how many times I’ve wanted wet wipes since voting Against the previous prop.

Proposal 286,Supported By,0x3cbd57da2f08b3268da07e5c9038c11861828637,1.0,"My thesis as a delegate is: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”  My analysis of funding requests is: 1. Is this a public good? 2. Is this public good something that other organizations won’t fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?  This proposal wants to build a sustainable, profitable business. Which is excellent! But it’s not building a public good. Likewise, there are many outlets for funding CPG branding plays, though they do often require some upfront capital.  This proposal also feels like a “proliferate the meme” type of proposal, which is fun and interesting, but doesn’t serve public goods.  For this reason, I was tempted to vote Against. At the same time, as I was analyzing this proposal, I began to think of all of the ways this brand could serve public goods-oreineted goals.  The design contest is an obvious starting point. Inviting artists to participate, and ideally having commissions or a portion of the profits flow back to them, is one way. The community contributions are strong here, showing that this brand is already acting as a gathering place.  It could also help other groups bootstrap knowledge in building CPG brands. Ideally, the team could aid other groups wanting to launch Nouns-related CPG projects. In the long run, fewer of these projects would need to be funded by the DAO and could instead be funded by an ecosystem of self-sustaining CPG brands.  For this reason, my inclination is to say yes to experimentation. I’d want to wait and see how this plays out before approving similar props. Does this end up as a community driven CPG initiative?

The exposure that we will get from the street gallery and the event itself are invaluable.

This conference seems pretty generic as far as NFT/ tech conferences go and I question how much value Nouns will get out of a sponsored presence. That being said, communication from the conference and proposing team has been *inconsistent* at best.   One of the biggest issues I noticed was 1/3 of the prop money ($30k) would go to a conference “sponsorship” and I still can’t figure out what we would get for that sponsorship.   In the conference brochure there isn’t a $30k sponsorship package listed, although the team claims they were able to negotiate with “inner web3 circle” for a better deal.   The sponsorship packages listed in the provided brochure are: $12k, $20k, $40k, $80k, and $200k. So what do we get for our $30k sponsorship exactly? One member of the team mentioned they negotiated the $80k package down to $30k, another member said we are getting the $200k package for $30k. I’m still left trying to figure out what we get for a $30k sponsorship and how can we verify this?    I requested that the team provide an invoice or some documentation of this $30k sponsorship package and what comes with it, but as of this vote I have not received this.   There are also inconsistent metrics cited for expected number of attendees. In the prop text, the proposing team claims 30,000 attendees are expected, but then in provided conference graphics the claim is 40,000 attendees are expected.   I think there is enough inconsistency in statements from the team, provided graphics, and plans for spending our investment that we should not grant these funds."

When a meetup exists as a gathering place, especially a neutral one that is not trying to sell anything, it can lead to excellent results.  It’s often hard to get sponsorship for meetups. Companies may sponsor to sell their own products, but finding sponsorship for meetups that act as a more neutral gathering place is difficult.  The amount of funding is pretty similar to the amounts required by much smaller scale meetups. Even though it’s a large amount, it goes a long way to make Nouns as gathering place for public goods."

Its true that a treasury-draining attack is unlikely in the current state, but important to stay far away from the cliff edge rather than see how close you can get.

Prefer that dynamic quorum stay at 20% or above."

ETH is spent, configurations altered. Something could break. Someone could rug the treasury. Fundamentally, I understand why we would give extra weight to Against votes. When a proposal is rejected, nothing happens. We are safe.  Dynamic quorums original intention was to defend against DAO attacks which target voter apathy. Was Prop 269 an attack? The more we talk about dynamic quorum parameters the more it just feels fiddly to me, like were micromanaging the DAOs actual decisions.  Everyone was watching Prop 271 because the outcome could be determined by a single vote. I find myself yearning for simplicity. Life is more exciting on the other side of the threshold.  I think were looking at technical solutions for what is ultimately a social issue of consensus. If we want to spend less, or more, or fund more art, or less art, or more blockchain public goods, I think the path forward is communication and campaigning for support within the DAO."

I dont think the added hurdle really serves us well.  you could say that it was only triggered 1 out of the 20 recent props so it is just inconsequential. it doesnt have much cost. but I consider the cognitive cost to be real. like bloat in a code base. its bloat in the governance process. a specific threshold until which AGAINST votes have double the weight. proposers and voters have to remember and track that each prop.   Im voting to reduce this hurdle and cognitive load.

I really appreciate Nounlius putting this up and their reference to my past vote on this topic. A few thoughts  1. Putting the quorum back to 15% feels kind of low conviction. If we are ideologically opposed to the DQ and favoring AGAINST voters, we should set it to 0/the quorum.  2. The DAO just voted on this. I open to seeing how this goes. So far, I do not think it has led to an unhealthy about of props failing to pass.  3.

Following the implementation of a higher quorum via Proposal 261, only one proposal has failed to meet the new threshold - Proposal 269, the Gnarly EP. The rest of the proposals either succeeded in reaching the quorum or received more against than for votes.  However, I continue to believe that proposals receiving a majority of for votes but failing to pass due to not meeting the threshold is ultimately detrimental to Nouns at this stage.   In my original vote against raising the quorum, I expressed opposition to the idea of hell yes voting, arguing that the DAOs best interests lie in being open to individuals who are interested in building. When the DAO becomes too focused on hell yes votes, it will receive less attention and energy. Some of the best innovations have been born out of skepticism and doubt.  I look forward to seeing more proposals work to proliferate Nouns in weird and wild ways and hope that other voters continue saying yes to bold ideas.

To that end, while I dont find this proposition to be malignant in its intent, I dont see the obvious value, and am more averse to creating governance bloat, where we have a bunch of active rules and parameters to operate within, making future proposals harder to pass.

Proposal 280,Opposed By,0xc7a0d765c3af6e2710ba05a56c5e2ca190c2e11e,1.0,"This particular proposal, while obviously harmless, raises some important questions about what kind of proposals the DAO should be soliciting.  Though the proposals premise is that the DAO gets to name a Noun, the proposal itself suggests the name. Though the proposals background section should state why this is something Nouns members should support, whats written acts only as an advertisement for NFTR. Though the proposal is free, it of course requires members of the DAO to vote, requiring gas fees.   This is not to say that we shouldnt pursue fun proposals, but rather that as a community we should be mindful of the potential for proposals to be used for purposes beyond their stated intentions.  In this case, it may be worth considering whether there are alternative ways to engage the community in a fun and lighthearted manner, without compromising the integrity of the governance system."

Many attempts to fund alternatives have failed. The primary alternatives tend to have very specific backers who are pushing forward their interests, and arent creating a neutral space for experimentation. That is why its even more important for Nouns to fund an open source, crypto-focused operating system as a public good.  Hardware and operating systems are extremely hard. They require a lot of capital, far more than this prop is requesting. Nouns should give this initiative a small push and keep it going, to help incubate it for when its ready for substantial funding. We cant solve everything, but we can do our part."

Ive personally been an Apple fan boy for many years, but am ready to give this a shot as my main phone just because I am so tired of how Apple has treated crypto. I had actually looked into getting setup but didnt feel like buying an old phone. Having a preinstalled option on the latest phone will be huge.   My biggest complaint is that I wish there were a better story to this prop: the ask feels small and like were partially just paying for a Nouns gtm option to sell back to us.   I wish the ask was larger, with a clear narrative of how our funding can be a key differentiator for the team, and a better story around how Nouns can be featured: e.g. a Noggle easter egg on all phones?  Nonetheless, I am voting FOR! Because  1. After talking with the proposers, it seems they went with the lower amount after informally getting pushback on a bigger ask. This will be the largest funding amount theyve received to date and really will meaningfully help them get to market quicker.  2. Notwithstanding what I said about, the Nounish device option is cool and should be fairly high visibility.  3. I think there is a good story here that will reach an important audience. The people excited about ethOS are Ethereum maxis who are Nouns adjacent, if not already plugged in. Of all the people we reach across various props, these people are highly likely to (a) be excited about public goods and the ethos of Nouns and (b) have the means to acquire a Noun or minimally become active in the community. I am excited about funding things that are highly charismatic to those we want to--and can realistically--draw in!  Lets make it happen!"

My one hesitation: I strongly believe that Nouns should have a much stronger branding presence than is suggested in the proposal. Any Nounish components should not be optional, but instead default. However, looking at Apenouns votewithreason, it looks like the team is open to sweetening the pot if this proposal passes. "

Proposal 279,Supported By,0xe3d73daae939518c3853e0e8e532ae707cc1a436,1.0,"Pros: The operating systems foundational role in any software makes it a ripe candidate to make cryptonative, so that other applications and services built on top can enjoy its architectural assumptions. In addition, even if this particular instantiation doesnt take off, the open source nature of the OS can promote some future project to build on top of a base.  Cons: Skeptical that a new OS is what gets people to switch their current phone just for cryptonative benefits. Much more likely that dominant crypto adoption comes through app diversity in established OS app stores, or via browser functionality within a web3 app (like what Metamask does today).   Net: Positive - Despite the visible difficulties of new OS adoption, if anyone can help fund a run on a new system its Nouns DAO. The proposal seems very aligned with the DAOs overall goals of promoting the nounish meme alongside contributing to the long term development of the crypto ecosystem. This is an experiment worth running, and the fact that the team has already been making progress is a positive signal - were helping a team thats already been helping themselves. "

Moreover, I recall Samsung having done some significant pushes for a crypto wallet to be built-in to their phones before and yet adoption was quite lacklustre. HTC also famously made a big push about 4 years ago, I even recall seeing their booth at EDCON 2019.  I just have too many doubts against the ability of this prop to provoke significant proliferation and mainstream adoption. I am sorry."

Proposal 278,Supported By,0x3cbd57da2f08b3268da07e5c9038c11861828637,1.0,"My thesis as a delegate is: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”  Funding crypto regulatory advocacy is an excellent example of a public good. It is something that benefits the entire ecosystem, and it is something that many groups won’t fund. This funding is especially powerful coming from a more neutral organization like Nouns. Advocacy from VC funds and companies is excellent and their work is incredibly important, but Nouns serves a special role by decoupling its advocacy from direct financial interests. This advocacy also benefits Nouns and other DAOs, which lack significant amounts of regulatory clarity.  I understand concerns by Scott and others that regulatory advocacy is off-mission (https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is/status/1652699651265503233). Those concerns are thoughtful, and I agree that Nouns is not and should not be an advocacy organization for regulatory change. At the same time, I draw a strong distinction between funding advocacy and directly participating in advocacy. Funding advocacy in my mind is on-mission as a public good, but participating in advocacy is likely something that the existing advocacy groups can do far better than Nouns. As long as Nouns sticks to funding only, advocacy can be an effective public good.  That being said, I wish this proposal was stronger in its advocacy for Nouns PR. In my opinion, Nouns is not aggressive enough in advertising its donations, and that hinders it from attracting people and acting as a beacon for public goods. Claiming the top spot on the leaderboard is a good start, but I wish the proposal went further on advocating for Nouns publicity. A few things that I wish were addressed in the proposal: 1. Nouns would be putting up 50% of the funding for the crypto advocacy round (Coinbase put up the other $100K, with the rest being direct donations from users), but the description on the Gitcoin Grants Round only states that  “Coinbase is on a mission to advocate for digital asset policies here in the United States, and this crypto advocacy round will support the amazing organizations who are leading the charge.” I would love a commitment from Coinbase and/or Gitcoin to include Nouns in the description of the advocacy round if this proposal passes. Coinbase, Gitcoin, and Nouns are stronger together! This is a collaboration I’d love to see. 2. I wish that Nouns had suggestions on how the advocacy organizations that will benefit from the matching funds could collaborate with Nouns. These don’t need to be requirements, merely suggestions. For example, welcoming advocacy organizations and their members to participate in the Nouns Playground and set a Nouns from the Playground as their PFP would set a nice norm, whether or not those groups choose to adopt it. (I also recognize that in this case, the amount is on the smaller side for that kind of PR.) 3. The history of the Shield emoji and Coinbase is something that I wish the proposal clearly discussed. It’s worth noting that the Shield emoji is repurposed from the “Coinbase FUD protection squad” (https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1551956224232628224) and was previously used by Coinbase employees and supporters to signal support for Coinbase as a company. While there are only so many shield emoji available, it is relevant for Nouns voters to know that they’re participating in an initiative that is repurposing symbols that supported Coinbase as symbols to support the industry. I am perfectly fine with this, but the history is relevant as Nouns thinks about how much it benefits from branding here.  In short, while Nouns could do more to advocate for itself and get stronger PR benefits from this, I am in support of this proposal. Funding regulatory advocacy is a public good that benefits the ecosystem, and I believe it matches Nouns’s mission as long as Nouns sticks to funding only."

One of the greatest things about nouns in my opinion is that it can be many similar things to many people at the same time.

This proposal is about safeguarding the longevity of web3 and its potential to create a better future for all.   I also think that its a great idea to push Nouns to the top of the leaderboard for minting this Open Edition. Nouns should work to become a leader in the broader web3 ecosystem by regularly interacting with projects in this manner.  This is an excellent opportunity for Nouns to take a stand for a meaningful cause and expand its overall presence."

This is, in my opinion, PRECISELY the type of project that the DAO should be backing wholeheartedly.  Approving this proposal would give an artist six months to build out a piece of hardware that has already seen demand and make it available at a relatively low cost. While some may view the funding as solely a cost for product, its important to recognize that this investment also has the potential to significantly increase awareness of Nouns within the artists community.  This proposal presents a unique opportunity to support an artist while simultaneously promoting Nouns. Not only will the hardware itself be a tangible representation of Nouns values, but the artists social media efforts and the products CC0 standing will serve to introduce new people to the Nouns ecosystem and its mission. If this proposal fails to pass, I find myself curious if the DAOs core values are truly about growth, adoption, and proliferation. "

Proposal 272,Opposed By,0x3cbd57da2f08b3268da07e5c9038c11861828637,1.0,"A quick summary of my thesis as a delegate: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”  I feel strongly that Nouns should not have a namespace that distinguishes between “canonical” projects and all other projects. Once a project is viewed as canonical, it will be hard to dislodge. Nouns should have a healthy ecosystem where projects naturally form and die. This allows contributors to step up, and just as importantly allows contributors to move on.  Much of this perspective is influenced by the Loot community, where projects viewed as “canonical” had significantly more sway among users than equivalent projects that were not viewed as “canonical”. If Nouns begins to bless certain projects with a canonical namespace, it will take energy away from non-canonical projects.  One simple hypothetical: What if Agora had a canonical namespace at nouns.agora.eth but House of Nouns did not? Is Agora now more “official” than House of Nouns? Should we bless more projects with official namespaces, to put them on a level playing field? What happens when those projects evolve, sometimes in ways that an official namespace would not like?  This is a slippery slope and I am opposed for that reason. As a courtesy, I registered nounsautobidder.eth and autobiddernouns.eth under my ENS at Papper.eth (also the owner, not the manager, of this ENS). I am happy to transfer these ENS domains to the team, and I am disappointed and a bit surprised that the team did not protect these ENS names prior to putting this proposal up. Canonical namespaces are a slippery slope, so let’s stick to non-canonical ones while norms develop."

The key details of the Open Edition mint should have been included here, including revenue split. Have you considered minting each chapter? Ideally you build up an audience as you go.   Once complete, what are the plans for publishing this and getting it out into the world? How are we going to get people to read this?

Proposal 271,Supported By,0x3cbd57da2f08b3268da07e5c9038c11861828637,1.0,"My thesis as a delegate is: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”  I’ve gone back and forth on this proposal quite a bit. My analysis of funding requests is: 1. Is this a public good? 2. Is this public good something that other organizations won’t fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?  Writing about the Nouniverse is not necessarily a public good, but public domain writing about Nouns is. Public domain writing, just like CC0 art or freely licensed code, is composable. While the ways it could be remixed may be less obvious, its equally important as other forms of composable creative work.   My other lens is whether this is something that other organizations wont fund. There are many established pathways to funding books, even if they are admittedly hard to access. Nouns is also not uniquely suited to funding novels. But at the same time, these established pathways are less accessible for public domain works, which the proposal points out forgoes revenue opportunities. (That is why many books choose CC BY-NC-SA as their license, to ensure that the work is able to be shared freely by readers but not used commercially).  The concerns that other voters brought up around the size of the ask and the fact that there are other established pathways for funding books are valid. At the same time, public domain composability for books is an important experiment. While I dont yet know what composability will result from this book, I believe that its a good experiment for Nouns. I am in support of this proposal, but would be more hesitant to vote for similar proposals until we see how the benefits of public domain composability play out for Nouns-related books.  (I would also note that I did read both chapters in full prior to making a decision, and I quite liked them. Though their quality is necessary but not sufficient for my support.)"

But after pausing for a moment I realized thats not how it should be.  Governing the DAO on a lets hope for the best kind of mindset is not feasible.  Sure, I could ignore my concerns with this proposal. Like it not having any distribution plans or the unexplained cost or even the fact that an open mint is just selling it to ourselves... But is that what Nouns are about? Trusting that something is nounish enough and hoping it works out? I dont believe so.  I have nothing against the idea of a Nounish childrens book per se. As a matter of fact I think its a great idea. One of my core beliefs as a Nouner is that we should heavily fund creative people and initiatives. What I am against though, is not having a plan. We have to change the mindset that being nounish = throwing caution to the wind and fund anything. Not having something amazing to support is not an excuse to fund anything.  Recent Props like 256(Triple backflip in a Wheelchair) or 263(Nouns Esports) are perfect examples of what we should be funding. They are creative ideas by people that can deliver and have a plan. Thats nounish, nounish af.  To Tasha, I would encourage you to bring back a revised version of this prop with more details. Explaining why the cost makes sense for this project, compare it to other known authors and market rates for this kind of work.

Proposal 271,Opposed By,0xa2e41625416d46302e7352f56f8de92aadb6e886,1.0,"Alana here, from Variant. We’ve decided to vote against Prop 271.  Our rationale stems from a mix of concerns regarding alignment with the broader goal of NounsDAO, the effectiveness of propagating the Nouns meme, and the justification of the cost of the proposal.  One of the things that excited us most about joining NounsDAO was its mission of funding public goods and the self-sustaining mechanism it invented to continue to do so. A middle-grade novel strikes us as distinct from more powerful public goods initiatives we’ve seen, like cleaning up trash in Africa or funding the planting of trees. We’d love to see Nouns devoting funding toward bigger, more ambitious projects.  Second, the proposal contains no plans for distribution of the novel. Key to Nouns’ mission is propagating the meme. Creation of content is important, but the true execution is in distribution. Even if we imagine that the novel achieves moderate success, the distribution will be most potent among children (likely 7-10 year-olds, i.e. the ones who read the novel). In our view, that’s not the target audience for Nouns; the funding mechanism only works if people feel compelled to buy into the community, and creating emotional ties with children may struggle to fulfill the Nouns flywheel (auction funds Treasury → Treasury funds projects → projects increase demand for the auction → and so on) in the short-medium term.    Third, 25 ETH for this proposal feels expensive, at least with the justification for funds given in the prop. To date, we have tried to avoid debates on the cost of funding associated with proposals, given a key component of Nouns is the ability to easily unlock funding for unique and attention-grabbing experiments. 25 ETH without any plans for exogenous distribution – and simply a plan to release a timed open edition (where demand for the mint will likely be endogenous from the Nouns community) – seems a potentially ineffective use of funds. That’s not to say there may not be a strong justification for 25 ETH without a go-to-market plan; rather, we simply did not see one in the proposal. A more effective request, for instance, would have included detail about market comps for the cost of publication to better benchmark a reasonable expected cost.   The reason we feel compelled to mention funding here is because we want to prevent the setting of a precedent in which the Nouns Treasury is seen as a free money machine. Funding should be easily accessible, but should match the boldness or proliferation expected with each proposal.  One thing of note is that the creator feels part of the 25 ETH is necessary to compensate them for forgoing future revenue streams; in other words, the upfront payment covers for the lack of a longer-term stake in the success of the novel. To us, this suggests there may be a better way than pure ETH grants to reward creators for contributing to the community: find a way to give them a stake in the success of Nouns. We’ve been exploring ideas related to this challenge in incentive alignment, and hope to have additional ideas to share with the community soon.  And finally, we’re still excited by this proposal and appreciate the author’s hard work. We encourage the author to resubmit a proposal, with a revised plan for funding and/or more detail on distribution for the project. "

There has not been clear consensus on the matter. Rather than letting disagreement stall the DAO I believe its important to support a few competitive solutions and let them prove themselves.  This is interesting technology, its already built, and it would allow us to trustlessly funnel Nouns into the treasury. This tech does not allow for precise head selection (Beer for Bud Light, Chicken for Stoopid Buddy), which means there still is a place for a centralized group like NAC and other technical solutions being developed.  This is called a Trial but a broader vision is not communicated. I wish it were.   Im going to imagine that the next steps would be to fund this with much more ETH and let it run continuously. I am not a fan of the effect this would have on the auction experience for bidders and for people watching the auctions. Having a bot effectively enforce a price floor feels less fun and makes our core mechanism less authentic and entertaining.  Also, as a builder who would love to be compensated with a Noun at some point, this tool isnt the ideal method for me.

Proposal 268,Opposed By,0xae65e700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dd26f8146c0,22.0,I dont understand this prop tbh.  we currently use NAC to acquire nouns. theres flaws to NAC that we fully recognize and as a community have debated alternative designs extensively and settled on a path: https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/proposal/0xebe4aec5b96dc5c008902da341bcd4936f5aa09baf73daaa545259183b203089  then what is this proposal trying to say? that we should actually use this rather than the path weve set out? or that we should use this as a replacement of NAC for the time being?   lil nouns already uses this so the purpose of the prop is not to test if it works. after asking on twitter it seems like the purpose is to actually build social consensus around this as the preferred approach of the dao acquiring nouns.   but the prop is not written in a way to even have that conversation and if we were to have that conversation it has many flaws including the ones that wilson has pointed out.  voting no bc I dont think this is the best mechanism for the dao to acquire nouns and tbh I find the prop a bit misguided

Proposal 268,Opposed By,0xbc3ed6b537f2980e66f396fe14210a56ba3f72c4,3.0,"Thanks to Wiz for the prop and the work here.   I have several concerns about the mechanism design. Everyone can see the min and max bids, and so there is effectively a floor price on the auction. The incentive for the DAO and Noun holders would be to see the max bid realized and so someone could repeatedly bid (and get tips) from the auto bidder, and then outbid it, and bid again until the max bid is reached. I think in most cases it is better for someone to use a human bidder that cannot be gamed like this. If someone wants to bid at a specific price for a Noun they can just us a collection offer?   That said, it sounds like Lil Nouns is already using this and is happy with it, and I am glad to hear it is useful to them. Beyond my concerns on the mechanism design, I dont see a reason for Nouns DAO to use this right now.   From Twitter I gather that there is some idea here that this should be used to replace Nouns Acquisition Committee (NAC). I do not think this is a good replacement, and I would rather hold out for the paradigm where the DAO can directly vote to mint someone a Noun. Moreover, if this indeed a motivation it would have been better if it were stated directly in the prop, in my opinion.   Thanks again for your work on this and for the Nouns community at large! "

The visual concepts also looked great and got me excited for an eventual finished project. That being said, there are a few key issues with this proposal that pushed me to vote against.  Firstly, the team is proposing for the DAO to pay for all the manufacturing costs and the teams compensation. On top of that, they are receiving all the proceeds from the NFT sales. Seems we are double spending here. This needs to be further clarified.  Also, it wouldve been great to see a % of the sales being returned back to the treasury.  Secondly, I would have liked to see more on proliferation. The keyboards themselves will most likely be sold to people already in the ecosystem. So there needs to be some work done outside of the sales of the keyboards. This possibly comes in how exactly the subDAO will operate and how It can push nounish ideas forward. In general I believe more things should be explored on this front.  This is definitely an interesting concept, I would be open to a revised version of this prop.  "

Moreover, the financial ask is completely reasonable, the team has experience, and theres a plan to make this a permanent item in a physical store.  I believe that one of the biggest advantages of Nouns as a DAO is the ability to support unconventional and creative projects that may not receive funding elsewhere. The request for $20,000 (almost entirely going to manufacturing with minimal overhead) seems like a worthwhile ask.   The worst case scenario here is that these are made and mostly used as a giveaway item at web3 conferences. That would be fine! But in a best case scenario, these become a staple of someones shopping experience, helping to normalize NFTs and demonstrate how DAOs can turn unique ideas into reality.

Sustainability: Once this run of wipes is manufactured and possibly sold, how does this move forward perpetually? Will there be another prop for more funds to make more wipes?   Return: I noticed the prop includes renumeration; why wouldn’t these funds go back to the DAO and/or used to facilitate sustainability of the effort?"

I do not think it is offering meaningful risk protection: proposals are watched pretty closely and I think there is near 0 risk someone drains the treasury due to low voter turn out.   Functionally, dynamic quorum serves to privilege against votes. Up to the dynamic quorum max, every vote against basically counts as two votes for. To me this seems unfair and is uncommon to all IRL dominant functioning forms of democracy that I am aware of.   So, in addition to being against this prop, I think I would be in favor of setting the quorum max = quorum min to address that these odd incentives affect the DAO much more than the hypothetical risk we are trying to guard against.

While I understand the importance of creating a quorum function that represents the DAOs interests as a whole, I believe that the DAOs best interests lie in being open to anyone interested in building. A DAO that becomes too focused on hell yes votes is a DAO that receives less attention and energy.   Some of the best innovations have been born out of skepticism and doubt."

Id also throw in the idea that similar to a gradient for required consensus, we adopt a gradient for proposed funding.

But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.  According to the “squad vote” result for proposal 258, which is 0 for, 30 against and 0 abstain, we choose to vote against.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):  Opinions opposing this proposal: 1. This is not community building. Its merely Satori and Bixbite doing business with Nouns, a business that is not advantageous for Nouns. 2. Satori and Bixbites remarks in the Jungle channel, such as Lil Nouns is cheap so I gave them a cheap and Lil Nouns is a toxic environment, further convince me that they do not understand the spirit of the community. They display arrogance toward the individual community members, treating DAOs and communities as cold numbers. This is the worst and most repulsive proposal and proposers I have encountered. 3. NounsDAO needs to operate in a community-driven manner, incubating more teams that understand and love the Nounish spirit. Today, NounsDAO has many teams that both love Nouns and can produce outstanding work. Yet, W3BSTOCK only seeks to be an outsourcing team, proposing a disadvantageous business deal. 4. I will continue to oppose such activities that use exposure as a gimmick. The traditional growth model that relies on increased exposure is effective because it has a unified company and growth system behind it. However, the conversion rate of each aspect of this growth method would plummet in NounsDAO, rendering it ineffective. NounsDAOs growth engine comes from numerous small teams that love Nouns and have comprehensive capabilities, as well as the establishment of specific social relationships. 5. Nouns may no longer need this type of exposure.  Supporting views on the proposal: 1. A dedicated event organizer possesses sufficient professionalism. 2. They have participated in the Lilnouns community and observed the Nouns community. Although they maynt to adapt, they have their own understanding of decentralized governance issues.  Points of uncertainty include: 1. Bitcoin has never rejected anyone. Conflicts between native and external teams can be observed in various projects. On one hand, I have seen cases where bringing in professionals to solve problems for projects ended poorly. Native teams must build every module from scratch, and there are no shortcuts. On the other hand, the MakerDAO model shows that, despite severe conflicts between native and external teams, they are not mutually exclusive at the protocol level. Instead, they should be embraced by the protocol."

Bad Aspects: - The team will rely on external help for hosting, photo sets, swag, and recording, which may result in varying quality across different events. - Events may be subject to change, and the team will need to adjust accordingly.

Proposal 257,Abstained By,0x2a019853a00ca3af202c262076da3308f606277f,1.0,"Imagine a world where voting does not exist. In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.  According to the “squad vote” result for proposal 257, which is 13 for, 19 against and 14 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):  Opinions opposing this proposal: 1. The past three Nouns Fairs seemed to prioritize creating a lively atmosphere more than genuinely onboarding builders, and they did not showcase Nounish ideas and products born at hackathons (perhaps its not apparent yet, as some builders might not have built products on the spot but developed ideas later). 2. Financial details are excessively indulgent: (1) the average cost of each fair is $38,438, while the bounty for rewarding builders is only $5,000, accounting for 13%, with the rest considered as marketing costs; there is too much budget allocation for marketing surrounding the Hackthon; (2) after three iterations, some aspects could be standardized and streamlined to avoid reinventing the wheel, such as reusing materials, resulting in instances of financial waste; (3) the costs for each event vary, but in planning, each is set the same; if the funds are not fully used, will they be returned to the treasury? 3. Data does not meet expected plans. The organizers initial goal was 1,000 Twitter followers, but after the first event, the actual number was 580. After hosting three events, Nouns Amigos currently has 1,200 followers, with the growth rate gradually decreasing and an average of 300 new followers per event. 4. In Proposal 180, the team pledged to save funds, with excess funds to be returned to NounsDAO. However, this statement is removed in the current proposal, and after 36 hours of inquiring on Discord, there has still been no response. The team has made some changes in the crucial details of the proposals financial aspect. It makes me feel that the team deliberately doesnt want to clarify the issue of financial waste, and I am concerned about whether the team might obtain undue benefits from the implementation.  Supporting views on the proposal: 1. The issue is not whether the proposal should be implemented, but rather its cost-effectiveness. Raising Nouns influence at Ethglobal IRL hackthons is something that should be done, with cost-effectiveness being a secondary concern. 2. The team can establish a professional Web3 event standard operating procedure (SOP). 3. The team has a track record of three successful events. The current Twitter followers are 1,000+. The average cost per follower is $50,000/1,000, or $50 per user. The data performance is at least average.  Points of uncertainty include: 1. I have not been to ETHGlobal in Mexico, Bogota, or San Francisco, so I cannot understand the local atmosphere. Moreover, the most important aspect of offline marketing proposals is the specific implementation by the two members; we need to hear firsthand opinions from those who have interacted with them.  2. Although team have been able to execute events in the past, the team seems to have abandoned many original principles and become increasingly wasteful in the proposal, which makes me cautious. 3. NounsDAO proposals may exhibit a pattern of gradual governance attack. This starts with a few Small Grant deliveries, then bundles what should have been several small proposals into one large proposal, delivering low-quality results and pocketing the funds in between. This is an issue with the NounsDAO system. The NounsDAO system is imperfect, lacking supervision and feedback for long-term large proposals, as well as continuous incentives, potentially causing good actors to turn bad. Could Proposal 257 be an example of this gradual governance attack pattern? How can we solve this problem? 4. There are many conflicting thoughts regarding NounsDAOs financial scrutiny: 4.1 I believe that strict financial control will not yield good results, as financial systems need a mature community culture and relevant modules. Insisting on stringent requirements for any financial aspect in the absence of a solid foundation will do more harm than good to the system. 4.2 I think a 30% premium above the market rate is acceptable. Extra profit will make proposal deliveries more standardized and sustainable, reducing the sense of confusion and uncertainty for the implementing members on the cutting edge. 4.3 I can also understand the strict financial stance is resonable; if there is a 70% reduction in financial advocacy, then a 30% reduction in the financial budget may also be acceptable to the community. We should stick to strict financial discipline."

Now NounsDAO funds an inspirational star who knows nothing about Nouns and has done nothing for Nouns, implanting a positive and optimistic brand spirit in everyone, which is an extremely rigid and inflexible brand strategy that does not fit with Nouns. Nouns brand is a completely different model from previous brands; it is a headless brand where people feel the projects branding characteristics from community members experiences. For the branding of Nouns, vivid stories or creatively concise memes should be used to enhance culture and build community consensus rather than funding a celebrity who has no understanding of Nouns. I strongly oppose the 256 proposal, which uses a solution that is fundamentally incompatible with both our thinking and operational methods to shape the Nouns brand. 2.

I think the people who would see this and want to join Nouns because of it--want to help fund more stuff like this--are people I would love to work with. The asymmetric upside of most props is in how far and wide the story might go: how many people it might inspire. I feel this is high potential, in this regard.  2. Its a prop were Nouns uniquely can unlock something: would this happen without Nouns? Probably not. We can make all the difference.  3. I am a fan of props that fund a specific deliverable which can be used forever with no maintenance: in this case Nouns gets a story and video that can be used forever and has no upkeep.

The community wallet product originated from a private social club similar to FWB, which is more suitable for closed community scenarios and not applicable to open Nouns. However, it may be adopted by subDAOs of Nouns. 2. Why should Nouns pay 120 ETH for an integrated service? The proposal for NounsWallet is different from Prop House and House Of Nouns building products from scratch for Nouns. The product was not adopted in FWB, and now they are applying for funding in Nouns to do integration, which is extremely unreasonable. Nouns provides both users and funds to integrate a product service. 3. There is insufficient confidence in timely delivery of the product. This is PoolSuite teams first proposal at Noun. In the past, the team has delayed delivery of products such as https://grandleisure.org/.  Supporting views on the proposal: 1. The proposer of Proposal 255, PoolSuite, is a talented team with excellent aesthetics in their FM magazine products etc., even if there have been delays in delivery we are willing to wait for them to produce results."

My goal is to find ways for it to pay for restaurants to rebrand as Nounish.  My bigger picture goal for it is to extend how we even think about the Nouns brand and how it spreads. How to make this into a repeatable Open Franchise kit, with the Nouns cc0 meme, open to all, such that any independent restauranter can plug into it and use aspects of it as they see fit (or not, open means use what works or nothing at all), and each one that plugs in enhances the entire network and its reach and relevance, a decentralized cc0 branded franchise. There are other elements to this stack that can be added by smart builders if they see an opportunity from loyalty/marketing/retention/rewards program/Web3 Point of Sale UX are all natural fits and some will be made in this Proposal but this model and kit will be open and evolve and incorporate what works and drop what doesnt over time.  Done well this Open Franchise Model mutually reinforces Nouns and whichever restaurants plug into it.  It could empower independent retail food service and create many proliferation opportunities that shoot off in a bunch of directions from customers to existing restaurants to people who are engaged by disruptive never before tried models.  This experiment has the potential to blaze this trail.  It will be on the team, who bring a track record running similar restaurants and businesses and who own Nouns and are committed to Nouns and are going out on a limb, to make this happen and create a model Nouns franchise.  This Proposal and the Nouns seed relationship and halo is what give it the chance to grow.  As to protections for the DAO, the cost side is what it costs to take this risk, we went back and forth on it.  Nothing seems out of whack or inflated, they are making disruptive changes to an existing business and its physical plant to effect this change. There are milestones in place from within the multisig controlled by Nouners so theres also controls if it runs into an insurmountable challenge and has to stop.  If we spend the ETH and the big dream doesnt materialize, we learn from it and have at least a singular Nounish restaurant that will persist.  Youre welcome Melbourne.  Prospectively, I wouldnt pay for restaurants to rebrand as Nounish --> the goal is to find ways for it to pay for restaurants to rebrand as Nounish."

The proposal emphasizes business model innovation, but using a points program to maintain user loyalty without any community ownership does not reflect innovative business models. Existing Web3 consumer explorations have shown that even if the community has a little bit of ownership, the effect will be very different. 2. The biggest concern is sustainability. Some long-standing old stores root themselves in the community and condense rich social relationships. However, operators in this proposal rely more on Nouns12 to maintain it. If people who have been in restaurants for a long time do not see or understand information about Nouns belonging to the community, then the relationship between such restaurants and Nouns is very fragile over time. In other words, if operators of the Nouns brand do not love their community, its actual effect on Nouns culture and brand will be minimal. 3. I asked about restaurant ownership issues with Nouns12, and they replied that there was no connection between restaurant ownership and Nouns; it only had promotional effects on branding. From this perspective, its not cost-effective. 4. We are unfamiliar with Australias commercial environment and concerned about instability in offline space operations - such as local restaurant closure rates or whether its possible to spend $200k decorating an establishment only for it to become unprofitable after one year.  Supporting views on the proposal: 1. Ive always had special feelings towards physical spaces offline. Buildings are not just functional venues but also condensed things within meaning worlds that remain unchanged. Building a square in a community where social interactions occur frequently - like children playing around or lovers being intimate - remains constant while producing many interesting stories above them; layered cultures emerge from these buildings over time.Building architecture is unique because promoting culture is difficult yet when an offline entity exists long enough; interesting stories continue emerging from them creating multi-layered cultures. 2. Despite having several problems highlighted by opposing views regarding short-term benefits versus costs involved with this proposal, its worth exploring and seeking Co-Creates consultation and assistance.

Proposal 253,Abstained By,0x2a019853a00ca3af202c262076da3308f606277f,1.0,"Imagine a world where voting does not exist. In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.  According to the “squad vote” result for proposal 253, which is 6 for, 10 against and 11 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):  Opinions opposing this proposal: 1. The theme of Hack Week is not clear, and the proposal is a bit rough. 2. Time. The poster indicates that it will be held from 3.27-4.2, which is very urgent. 70% of the effect of Hack Week comes from early preparation and BD, especially as an online hackathon, the promotion and BD time in the early stage needs to be longer. 3. 99 ETH expenditure is too high. Its unreasonable to hastily organize a Nouns ecosystem Hack Week for about $200,000.  Supporting views on the proposal: 1. A replicable growth model has been proven in the Nouns ecosystem. From Open Round and private voting research rounds, this is the best Nouns growth model. And every launch will attract enough attention and increase community cohesion. This proposal belongs to repeating an already successful model to promote ecological growth for Nouns with no logical problems. 2. The difference in this proposal is that Hack Week will involve more operational work than Prop House rounds without promotion or operation; this replicable model can actually be optimized by Proposal 253 for mature growth within Nouns ecosystem. 3. Behind Proposal 253 are teams such as Nouns.build, Nouns Square, Grant Protocol etc., who together form a golden team among all proposals related to nouns - they are trustworthy due to their understanding of noun spirits as well as professionalism and execution capabilities. 4. On another note: I am concerned that overly professional requirements for proposals may stifle community atmosphere. Many proposers have no problem with logic or implementation but may get bogged down in how professional their proposals should be instead of focusing on whats best for nouns."

The finances for marketing proposals should be tightened. It is recommended that all marketing proposals go through the Small Grant channel. If they want to go through the on-chain major proposal channel, they must prove that there can be revenue and feedback to the treasury. The key indicator for evaluating a marketing proposal is whether or not it has a meme or story. The idea behind this proposal is obvious and lacks any story or meme. 2. Based on my current experience, I have observed that Nouns attract new community members and grow primarily through outstanding community products, the hard work of dedicated teams, the tireless promotion of Nouns by holders, and prop house rounds that demonstrate Nouns vigorous vitality of the community. However, Proposal 251 has created a Consumerism landscape that is not conducive to marketing and brand building within the community.Personally, I have no interest in marketing without incorporating memes or stories. Proposal 251 will not capture the recognition of both fashion circles and Crypto-Native partners, and instead make them feel like there is another naive buyer paying for trendy things while satisfying some peoples self-perceived pleasure in effective marketing. 3. Data shows that Proposal 197 had poor execution results after implementation with only one thousand views on Twitter review proposals with sixteen retweets compared to an investment of $120k resulting in low ROI.  Opinions supporting this proposal: 1. 3D printed fashion looks good and novel. 2. Danit Peleg (the proposer) has successfully delivered three rounds of proposals in the past. She is dedicated and can enhance the Nouns community. As an Israeli fashion designer, she became famous as the first designer to create 3D-printed clothing."

Proposal 248,Opposed By,0x2a019853a00ca3af202c262076da3308f606277f,1.0,"Imagine a world where voting does not exist. In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.  According to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 5 for, 18 against and 0 abstain, we choose to vote against.  The proposals opinion is clear, and we do not recommend taking Rage Quit immediately. Its not just an issue with the content of the proposal itself, but also the caution regarding the level of the proposal.  Our opposing viewpoints:  1. Refuse to change the constitutional-level rules of the DAO without evidence that Rage Quit is effective (MolochDAO rarely uses Rage Quit) or sufficient community debate. Proposals of this level require lengthy debate, repeated proposals and opposition, and then approval. Changing the underlying rules lightly is irresponsible to the consensus. It is normal for a system to have human flaws at every level. However, a casual attitude towards underlying rules could destroy the Nouns system, a stable system is better than no system. 2. NounsDAO already has a secondary market exit method. Rage Quit is a term that appears powerful on the surface, but in essence, it is a bad price market-making way. It does not have the game-theoretical effect it promises. 3. The importance behind Rage Quit is not angry, but forking. The execution of this proposal did not enhance the system or generate more viable branches, but resulted in a loss of consensus, which is negative on the margin. Instead, leaving feedback for continuous improvement of the system can turn it into a way to enhance the system. The efficiency of Nouns proposal supervision has also been improving and will continue to progress. 4. The proposal implies that everyone is angry, which is a language game. The fact is that most users have a mixed feeling of disappointment and hope. Any one-sided release of hope or anger will damage a system. 5. Earlier proposal 192 had a more comprehensive rage quit design called theDAO Split mechanism/design. The proposer, Verbs team, pointed out that although it is still under discussion with legal counsel, they believe it is the best solution for Nouns. They are now soliciting community opinions and think it is very urgent to implement it as soon as possible.  The supporting viewpoints for this proposal are very simple: 1. Promote the equal vision of Nouns: Each Nouns subdao represents Nouns, and NounsDAO is just one branch. This is a more attractive future, a dynamic and ongoing future."

Proposal 248,Opposed By,0xa2e41625416d46302e7352f56f8de92aadb6e886,1.0,"Alana here, from Variant. We’ve decided to vote against Nouns Prop 248.   A key risk is that rage quit risks a stifling of treasury funds. Each treasury activation / funding grant would at least temporarily lower the book value of Nouns, so holders are faced with a trade-off every time they vote on a proposal: fund the prop vs. preserve the book value of their Noun. In theory, this creates a forcing function for better evaluating the merits of each prop – only props which are believed to drive future value to the DAO in excess of the current book value of each Noun would pass. In practice, that’s hard to quantify proactively. The consequence could be fewer funding approvals, especially for more provocative experiments that may not have as explicit financial returns.   We recognize that, even if this proposal is defeated, it’s likely not the last time we’ll see a rage quit proposal submitted to the Nouns DAO. In light of this, it’s worth taking a moment to revisit some of what makes Nouns special:   The ability to activate funds for bold, unique experiments in brand and community building Highly engaged community members A consistent source of funding (the daily auction)  Any implementation of rage quit should seek to preserve those core primitives. 4156 has already proposed one alternative mechanism, whereby any Nouner who votes but lands in the minority on a proposal can rage quit as a sign of their dissent. This version would help encourage continued community engagement (by making voting a prerequisite to rage quitting), while preserving the ability of the community to access funding for projects. There may be other versions that preserve and protect the values of Nouns as well. We’re committed to evaluating each proposal on its individual merits. But today the version in question is what’s proposed in Prop 248, and we’re voting no. "

(I see many Nouns that have been trading on the floor on Blur voting for this.) I do not support the concept of Noun refunds, in general.

But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.  According to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 13 for, 19 against and 13 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.  Theres a lot of controversy surrounding this proposal, with only a four-vote difference between those against and those for/abstaining.  Supporting Points: 1. Atrium has proven their production capability. With a previous proposal, they delivered a remarkable 2-minute video with impressive speed and content, standing out from previous video proposals with poor delivery in NounsDAO. 2. Atriums video is relatively cost-effective compared to other high-quality videos.  Opposing Points: 1. For the same cost, ten meme shorts could have better reach. Nouns should focus on storytelling and creating memes  instead of high-quality. 2. Proposal 195 video fails to demonstrate the teams storytelling ability. There are no memes or compelling stories, and there is no motivation for secondary creation and propagation. The video has only received 86 shares, 166 likes, and 40,000 views. Moreover, the TikTok link on Zora is invalid. The video appears soulless with exquisite 3D models but a flat and bland story. 3. Nouns Town in Proposal 195 has no Nouns elements. Upon inspection, the town is similar to small towns in any animated film, as if it were a 2-minute video assembled from past materials."

Proposal 244,Abstained By,0x2a019853a00ca3af202c262076da3308f606277f,1.0,"Imagine a world where voting does not exist. In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.  According to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 19 for, 13 against and 12 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.  We support Proposal 244.  1. The Lilnouns community has adopted it, with over 160 ideas collected and turned into proposals through a proven process.   2. PropLots team is truly community-driven, able to identify and fulfill needs on the fringes of the community. They are a team with a Crypto-Native soul, and we believe in their future!  3. This is an interesting governance experiment. PropLot will become Nounishs wish pool, and if it becomes a reality, it would be too wonderful! Both Nouners could enjoy a more complete governance cycle and a more active ecosystem.  However, there are many concerns. The reason for these concerns is that 1. PropLots effectiveness in NounsDAO is in doubt. PropLot performs well in the Lilnouns community due to its member size and its integration into the lilnouns website.  But PropLot and NounsDAO are very different. NounsDAO is a network with only 341 holders (NounsDAO is not a community), while Lilnouns has a community of 2338 active members who generate many interesting stories on Discord.  In addition, if PropLot is not integrated into the NounsDAO website or the processes of Prop House or House Of Nouns, then there will be little interaction with holders and users. Although Nouns.Center has implemented this feature, its entry point is too deep, and no one uses it. These are the reasons why we do not believe PropLot will be successfully adopted in NounsDAO.  2. There are also many alternative products available. PropLots idea is simple and can easily be implemented by HouseOfNouns (in their proposal) or other products such as nouns.build and nounsagora.  Overall, we are willing to believe in them and take this adventure together!"

According to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 33 for, 8 against and 15 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.  The House Of Nouns proposal is one that is difficult to find flaws in.  We have two concerns:  1. NounsDAO has no ownership of the product that the proposal promises. Will the ownership of the product, as promised in the proposal, be allocated to NounsDAO? If there is no correlation, then the funds requested in the proposal are essentially for the team to develop a product that belongs solely to themselves using NounsDAOs funds. This is a proposal that harms Nouns and benefits the team.  2. Complexity of features. The product promises to implement a complete governance lifecycle, including collecting ideas, early-stage discussions, on-chain decisions, etc. This means that the functional requirements are complex, and once the complexity is identified, even the best product manager will find it difficult to handle.  First concern is not an issue with the 242 proposal, but rather with the immaturity of the NounsDAO system itself.  Overall, we like the House Of Nouns product and team for the following reasons:  1. We are frequent users of House Of Nouns. It is simple and has redesigned the user interaction logic to focus on proposals, rather than channels, communities, or governance participants. This is a new type of product, and it has been well received by users (we can attest to that).  2. House Of Nouns is the first governance tool to define a complete governance process, implying a standard for proposal governance. It is beneficial not only for NounsDAO but also for the Nounish and Crypto industry, as it promotes scientific and standardized governance.  3. House Of Nouns has an excellent product team behind it. They understand the Nouns spirit and have developed a new Nouns model product called thatsgnarly.ly. Behind House Of Nouns and ThatsGnarlys products, one can see a professional and continuous product development system, which is invaluable."

We abstained in the last proposal, because we appreciated DigitalOil’s exploration of dynamic range for community fundraising tools. The reason for the change in the outcome of the two rounds of proposals is that the new proposal became more and more difficult to understand, especially the second part.  We support the exploration of dynamic funding. The content of the second part belongs to a direction that is correct, but proposes an overly complicated experimental scheme. The new proposal itself did not improve, and requires a philosophical dialectical understanding to enter the context of the proposal, which is a good idea, but not a product that people need.  Although DigitalOil absorbed everyone’s opinions and made improvements. The financial and team parts of the proposal still did not improve, making the evaluation more difficult. We suggest implementing the first part of the product and applying for a “Small Grant”.  Although we vote against, we recognize DigitalOil’s product philosophy, and the mechanization of dynamic financial governance is a very important direction. Nouns’ funding support means are limited (on-chain proposal, Small Round, Prop House), and it is difficult to fund governance thinkers and developers like DigitalOil.  When the product is just an early personal idea, and has not reached the stage of being needed by the community, it should not use On-chain Proposal. Maybe we can open a round of “dynamic funding” Prop House to explore this path?"

Squad Vote result: Approval:Opposition:Abstention = 16:5:3.  The proposal was approved by all of us to provide an open database for the Nounish ecosystem. NounsDAO will benefit greatly from it. It will enhance the overall daotool development of the Nounish ecosystem. We support the team in exploring the path of data composability for Nounish. Infrastructure exploration is highly risky and uncertain. It is harder than imagined. But the team has a good track record to prove that they have a deep understanding and patience for it.  Our opposition mainly comes from: 1. Is it too early to do it now?  Nounish Dataverse may be like Web3 Social projects, unable to find Builders to develop products/tools that everyone needs, infrastructure but running applications that no one uses on top.   There is no information indicating that applications currently in demand (Prop House, Nouns Agora, House of Nouns, Nouns.Build, Dune Dashboard..) would consider using Ceramic as their data backend. It is much more difficult for applications to be demanded than to do underlying infrastructure. Holding a Prop House Round as mentioned in the proposal does not solve this problem.  2. The proposal delivers too much content  The Nounish Dataverse proposal promises a decentralized database based on Ceramic, developer documentation, ID system integration application… A single proposal combines too many things to do. We recognize 30% of what’s in the proposal but 70% is over-committed."

Mistakes happen, I have compassion for that.  But if we knew we had to buy 30k comics for $150k then, its possible the DAO would have voted differently given this would have increased the all-in cost by 50%.  As is, the evidence that there is demand for 30k comics isnt easily observable.  Why 5k and not 2k per issue?  After the original proposal was off, need more clarity and confidence to double down and buy our own comic.  Nounders voted No to a 10k toy run for Nounish Friends with unique composable figures by Klim and the rationale was that these would sit in a warehouse and that was cheaper than the comics proposal all-in.  How is there 3x demand for this at a higher cost to the DAO?  At $5/comic, that feels like we are paying retail prices for a wholesale relationship.  The explanation provided doesnt square for me.  We are bearing the full risk with no upside. There are live sites right now to buy these comics $3.5-4 at retail.  Its a discrepancy that stands out.

It bundles the YES/NO vote and the funding amount vote in a way such that I as a voter dont *really* know what Im voting for when I vote and if I have a preference in the funding range possibility I would  have to wait until the very last minute to cast my vote (for example, if I wouldnt be in favor if the funding amount landed on the high range, Id have to wait to see how many others vote in favor).  BUT Im in favor of experimenting to find better mechanisms we can use to reach non-binary outcomes for proposals and for that reason Im voting in favor. Even if this isnt used much or is used and we discover what the shortcoming is, that would be a plus in my book."

They could offer a way to take advantage of the concave decision making advantage of large groups: where any point along the spectrum from 0 to 1 is higher value than either a 0 or 1 outcome.   I also think the funding ask is reasonable, considering audit is included.   Good luck!"

It went ok but it hasnt left our bubble yet and the community around it is pre-traction.  As a platform, its very early and doesnt exist yet.  It doesnt warrant big spending (yet), its still very much at the experiment level.  Its on this team to prove out much more before its worth funding more.  It doesnt make sense for the DAO to take experiments and 5x or 10x the funding unless theres strong evidence that it was a clear win.  If this was continue to explore Noun Sounds and 50 ETH +  20 ETh for a CC0 music Prop House rounds, thered be something to debate, but after this ask and the strategy, Id lean No there.  There is serious issues here with strategy and not understanding that the partnerships with these famous musicians are not only very expensive marketing for a platform that isnt ready for it but also a poor fit for how to build a real organic CC0 focused music community of any kind.  You need people, small people, passionate people who vibe organically and dont need to be paid to vibe.  Find those people, engage them with Noun Sounds, build Noun Sounds and its community with them.  Money doesnt spend for that.  When Proposers are getting paid by the DAO in other places, its helpful and important to lay that out upfront.  The DAO deserves to know, the relationship is already so assymetrical, I expect our partners to be clear and WANT the DAO to be informed.    Id also want to see Proposals be transparent when they have relationships with entities they are funding in the Proposal itself.  It would help to know that Woody has a relationship with Save the Music -- it means that execution there is more likely to go more smoothly.  Its also important because the DAO should know when theres the potential for related party transactions. Its small dollars here so it doesnt matter as much right now but STM was also was mentioned in that this team expects funding for future STM proposals, so understanding that relationship is important.  It also highlights the lack of cohesion and focus here -- STM future proposals for even more money but also focusing on expensive celebrity marketing but also working on a pre-traction platform that will live and die by passionate CC0 creators that are not either of the first 2 groups is an odd admixture."

Having this music arm of Nouns is awesome. And I love LOVE the playlist idea - has some viral components. But I would like to see more budget aimed at on onboarding indie/web3-focused musicians rather than the big $$ budget on a Ghostface collab. Would support with a simple shift of that budget to more Prop House rounds & marketing those rounds.  - It’s a huge red flag you’re asking for 250eth from the DAO & won’t even answer questions in the discord Nouners are asking.

BuilderDAO giving you 25 ETH as they have, us voting on whether to give you 50 ETH or not, and you figuring out how to bridge the rest is a model that this DAO can support."

That’s why we’ve geared this prop to deliver an entirely open-source, openly owned codebase — so there is no centralized value capture, and anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the end deliverables. We think this completely aligns incentives and will help build a strong, open ecosystem.  What does open sourcing mean here? This means everything from the repo to the APIs will be open access, so people with varying levels of technical acumen can clone and re-host and build on top of House of Nouns. We’ll also be doing continual data dumps to Arweave for any offchain data.  Budget? While ETH is going up in price, we’ve decreased our prop’s total cost by ~$100k. We heavily increased deliverables and the speed at which we deliver them. We’re looking for 9ETH/month/developer, which is less than any other active developers for Nouns. We think that deliverables and actual matter the most, and think they are very justifiable for the cost of 190ETH in terms of the long-term impact they can have on the DAO’s success.  Integrations? We’re looking to be as open and composable as possible. We want to integrate the amazing work of others everywhere it makes sense, versus create clones and replicate any functionality. We want to be a bridge between the disjoint governance infrastructure in the ecosystem.  Thank you for your time sers <3"

Im totally open to the possibility that ultimately the benefits of full transparency can outweigh the benefits of privacy and we can as a community decide to maintain the status quo.  but I would like to have the conversation before dismissing it out of fear. and we cant really have a concrete conversation if we dont know whats even possible. this round imo is a step to find that out."

On a more serious note:  Im a big proponent of nounsdao funding public goods, especially in the software/crypto/ethereum domain, so on the one hand, i love this initiative.  But Ive come to the conclusion that private voting acts to further dehumanize nounsdao, and that, on net, we gain from having faces (or avatars) attached to votes for as long as possible. I believe nounsdao is better off in a world where voting comes with some social pressure to take responsibility and publicly stand behind voting decisions. I acknowledge social pressure also swings the other way (relationship costs, nepotism, etc) but Im willing to make that tradeoff vs cold, faceless PvP.  Even though the prop clearly says that whether to implement private voting is still TBD, I think funding this prop would heavily signal that nounsdao want to also adopt private voting eventually.  I would be interested in funding a prop that is better at keeping nounsdao private voting at arms length from the research, but im somewhat vary that even that would lead to eventual/quicker implementation of private voting."

I am uncertain about the usage in Nouns DAO, specifically. I can imagine a lot of ways in which private voting could make the DAO less healthy.

This is not a product I personally feel a need for or can imagine myself using. I generally connect with other Nouners only online, and to the extent we want to meet up in person, Discord or Twitter could be used to organize.  2. It seems like the tech is pretty much entirely built but just a new instance is needed for Nouns, and the funding ask seems kind of high given that.  3. Given the product is already built and working for other communities, I think the team should try to find a way to monetize the product/find sustainable funding. That will give better info about if there is real demand and for what exactly, whereas DAO grant funding is not sustainable. "

The main issue I have is that this creates a man-in-the-middle attack vector either by whomever is operating the platform or any defects in the software thats used and a false sense of security. Skiff may be interesting as it encrypts skiff-to-skiff emails (in this case emails sent between `@nouns.email` users) and incoming emails at rest but it doesnt magically grant the user the ability to have encrypted communications with all emails sent and received; emails from, to, and including non-Skiff users are still sent in plaintext. I believe the prop made this detail ambiguous at best.  Im also concerned around a centralized location for Nouners emails, this would be an attractive target for attackers.  I wish the Skiff team the best and would personally be interested in playing with their platform, but I dont believe this proposal should pass due to the ambiguity around privacy."

Putting aside the fact that all Nouners can afford to buy these glasses, and there is plenty of supply still available, handing out any of these glasses to Noun holders is possibly the lowest leverage opportunity for their distribution. Prop 185 was a much more thoughtful approach and I assume it will be much more impactful. I would prefer we hold our supply and execute on highest impact opportunities with focus on proliferation or brand building by association."

Of course we should give some of these glasses, entrusted to the DAO, to Nouners. But some valid concerns have been raised: Does this set a bad precedent of the DAO giving free stuff to Nouners? Using DAO holdings to reward Nouners? Should we be more focus on spreading the meme beyond the DAO? Can we avoid a distribution that favors those who hold several Nouns?   I am sympathetic these concerns and appreciate those who have raised them, but I am still for this proposal. Proposal 57, which funded the creation of 8,250 of these glasses, included an allotment of 500 glasses to NounsDAO itself. I consider 50—10%—to be a fairly modest portion of this allotment. I think giving them to DAO members is a fun use and a very reasonable way to “spread the meme:” I think we should have some faith that the Nouners who receive these will do interesting things with them!   150 have already been given elsewhere and after this 300 will remain. I hope those who want to see these go outside the DAO will put up proposals to make this happen. Let’s use them! In my opinion, there is no reason to be precious.   "

Really excited Nouns can draw in people new to crypto and this quality of proposal. That said, Im voting against. It’s a decent amount of ETH, both in absolute terms and as a % of the treasury. I don’t doubt that it is warranted for a quality event, but I think there are better ways the DAO could use the money. In particular, I am more interested in going deeper with our true fans than trying to reach out to a community that has historically disdained NFTs/crypto (the Dota subreddit responses to this proposal were not encouraging). I also felt a bit like the proposal was made to work for the proposers in a way that maybe doesn’t make the most sense for Nouns: the emphasis on using the proposer’s venue and the VIP Nouns experience. Finally, there were a lot of ideas here about how to use NFTs in the contest itself, but the proposers by their own admission seem to have little experience in the space. I think there’s a lot of subtlety here and it would take some real experience to get it right. Hope to see these proposers back with other ideas in the future!  "

Im a fan of proposals that clearly outline how they want to spend their money, and this one quite frankly did none of that.  However, I ultimately came to the conclusion that when funding a subcommunity or DAO, we actually dont necessarily need an understanding of the budget. The question, rather, is whether we trust that DAO to be valuable stewards of that money.  I see these types of proposals as cultural venture investments, similar to our  @nounsbuilder  funding. Just as a VC does not review all the expenses of their portfolio companies, Im not sure we need to know how exactly a subDAO is going to spend the money we give them. Rather, we just need to know whether a) we trust that the subDAO will steward those funds in a way that is positive for Nouns DAO, and b) if the cumulative ask is an amount of our treasury we are comfortable locking up until we see the cultural ROI from that spending.  The bar is super high for both a) and b), but this proposal meets both of them for me, so I decided to vote yes."

Proposal 189,Opposed By,0xd25973a3df7d2341ddea48303a3e6addec6184bf,28.0,"Really like gnars and everything theyre doing but this large of an ask in one swing feels too high for comfort  - Budget section of proposal feels too sparse on details. Who is being paid and how much? How fast is the ETH going to be used? How much would each event cost? can we know the events and whatnot upfront?   - Personally I dont like the idea of giving people ETH to buy 2 nouns. I had to spend 30+E to get mine, others much more. I could write a proposal saying Ill do x y z marketing give me a free noun, but that would be unfair. Nouns arent a cheap NFT, 30E is like a full years salary for many in the US.   - Gnars has daily auctions which give them ETH, they still have over 70E in their treasury to use (which is great given the 60ish we funded them with in the past). I feel gnars could be self sufficient and this proposal is asking for a large amount simply because it can.   - With 3360 Gnars in circ, giving gnars dao 700E would 10x the book value of a gnar when a noun trades at half. I know many in our DAO think this metric doesnt matter, its just a point worth keeping in mind for those that do care. "

We want to see continued development of it and for that reason we are voting a yes.   Our strong opinion is that Prop House and its protocol should be operated from its own Nounish DAO. This would move Prop House outside of a proposal based funding model into its own sustainable funding mechanism, it would also have the added benefit of creating a direct ownership link to Nouns. This would also mean that Prop House could utilize Prop House. The Prop House meme is already proliferating through many communities, it only makes sense to use a meme machine to accelerate this trend. "

Proposal 181,Supported By,0xcc2688350d29623e2a0844cc8885f9050f0f6ed5,11.0," **Nouncil Vote:**  35 Yes, 7 No, 2 Abstain  4 Nouncillors abstained from the decision  **YES WINS**  ---  **Vote Reasons & Discussion**  ---  **Bigshot Klim** | *I think this will be a very interesting experiment, especialy once there is more awareness and engagement after the Rose Bowl parade. I am for all of this prop.*  **CHEFFO ⌐◧-◧** | *I think @samellis ⌐◨-◨ summed it up on this one 👏 . My only thing would maybe bring the minimum view up a little, but that might be ambitious to start.*  *Content is king. If anyone saw the screens from Beyond Basel and other exhibits..it is clear that content wins. We need young creative talent to keep Nouns and all related projects relevant.*  *The Prop House element is excellent and a great use of that tech.*  *CHEFFO = YES*  **Mach** | *Low criteria with too high a reward. Poorly incentivizes growth and could potentially reward insane viewership $s*  **profwerder** | *This prop is a bit confusing tbh but there are some good team members here so I ultimately came to a yes after chatting with a zebra. I recommend the team create some clarity around the process so participants are clear on expectations and create some AMA sessions to answer questions. You may also want to jump on some spaces to talk about it & answer questions.*   **kerimbonia** | *i am interested in seeing how the mechanics of this proposal plays out as there is a lot to be learned in terms of attracting high caliber teams to the nouns ecosystem and getting the most impactful nouns content out of it. good luck!*  **Benbodhi** | *This model has proven positive on a smaller scale, will be interesting to see how it goes with such large rewards.*  **andreitr** | *Always yes for more content.*  **fiveoceans_dev** | *A very well written proposal! I like the idea and already can see that it will bring a lot of attention from creators.  I feel that it will be a successful proliferation campaign!*  **Graphic.⌐◨-◨** | *I feel like the reward at the end for participation in this will be a really cool incentive for people to create compelling nouns content for the next few months*  **Mindtoasted** | *This could give a huge boost to the underrated video creator teams out there, can also continue to encourage the production of more Nounish videos in a wider scope. If this goes smoothly there is a possibility that Nounish hype content will explode in some way. I vote yes.*  ---  For more Nouns DAO proposal discussion head to the Nouncil Discord: https://discord.gg/nouncil"

How is that measured? How much will the team get paid, who decides, and what is done with the money left over (if any)? 3. no transparency on how the 10 eth for builders will be distributed, how the decision process will be made and if anyone will be able to know about it. 4. the “5 eth of retro funding for what has been done to build this system already” - what is this for exactly? The network? Who is getting paid?   Not being scalable is not really an issue for me as I think this can stay at the same size and be helpful.  For a prop that talks so much about feedback, I’m surprised none was asked. So I’d welcome this prop again, after it had gathered feedback on these and other issues from the community. "

Given my recent posts on scaling small grants, I believe Prop 175 takes us in the opposite direction.  - Inefficient capital allocation The prop asks for 65Ξ to allocate 10Ξ, a ~90% admin overhead.  - Non-scalable approach The approach appears to revolve around consulting services that are very manually intensive and do not scale, unless we want to employ a small army of consultants at the DAO like a Deloitte, Ernst & Young, PwC, KPMG, etc.  - Unnecessary creation of static website tools We should lean into automated tools like Prop House or AddressBoard. Information repositories already exist in the form of Nouns Center, which is already linked to from the main Nouns website.  - Unclear outcomes or measurements of success How is success being measured here? What benchmarks would need to be hit so we can decide if we want to fund an effort like this again (or clone it in other areas)?  I encourage the team to discuss this with the builder community and come back with a prop that addresses the broader concerns raised on their efforts.

If the end goal is to get builders funded - Id much rather see the team pursue a small amount of funding to run their own grants program. This way, it is much easier to measure success while also allowing the team to find/consult with builders.  9999: The team is passionate and well placed to execute on this idea. I think it’s reasonable to get funds to test out a consultancy/incubator on a small scale, but I dislike subsidizing this entirely for 3 months when there’s an obvious business model.  In general, I am for the consultancy model and believe it can bring qualified builders to the DAO. To that end, the market has the ability to signal whether the PropBox idea/team/approach works and funding to the extent requested would distort this process. In addition to reducing the timeline and funding amount, I would recommend voting for this proposal if it had target metrics: 1 month, interface with 10-15 builders, target 1-2 amazing on-chain proposal, include a “finders fee” to subsidize the funding gap.  devcarrot: I agree with the other Nounders that there should be a market for this type of advising that takes the form of a finders fee or tip. I would like to see this proposal changed to either include more discrete objectives or, as Aubtoshi mentioned, expanded to be a source of earlier funding. During the Agora debate it was brought up that a place for builders and proposal authors are able to gain some clout, PropBox could be a way to incubate those with potential and build better proposals along the way."

Since winning that round (2 ETH), I have seen him work so hard to set up and roll out the .⌐◨-◨  network and identities that many of us love and use every day.   He has also reached out to every corner of the nouniverse to make sure .⌐◨-◨ is natively resolved almost anywhere you want to interact, from nouns.wtf and Agora to basically any nounish auction site you can think of.   He built all this foundation nearly for free, almost seven months of blood, sweat and tears for a couple ETH. Now he is asking the DAO to believe in the potential of the network and his plans for it, and I think it’s a worthwhile endeavor to give him some funding and runway to do so.   Phase 2 is all about proliferation of the .nouns (NNS) network and I think the planned 3-pronged approach of 1) continuing to integrate more communities to resolve . ⌐◨-◨ natively, 2) running social media campaigns and the Nounish Club initiative to make nns names more desirable and 3) seeding/spinning up a DAO with Nouns builder to create a flywheel of community proliferation using Prop House and other methods to reward community members who help spread the .⌐◨-◨ meme, is a powerful strategy to get as many nounish people as possible using this network daily (and therefore proliferating nouns across web3.)   Nouns will never have a token like $APE and I don’t think it ever needs one. But absent that, I think .⌐◨-◨ is a really cool and low-friction way to unite communities all over the nouniverse, and I’m looking forward to seeing what Dom and team can do with some ETH and a little runway.   Also, if the team does NOT knock this out of the part with their efforts in the first 3 months, Benbodhi and I have the right and obligation as multisig signers / milestone checkers to send the second half of the funds back to the DAO instead of releasing them. I of course don’t expect this to be necessary, but it does nonetheless lessen the outlay risk in my opinion, if you trust our judgment.

It concerns me when props dont make that type of financial incentive clear and upfront and hide behind we proliferate nouns and seeming as a public good when they are not. In this way NNS is not a public good (free public infrastructure) like prop house or nouns builder and thus should be dealt with a bit more skepticism imo.

My main worry is:  1) We have no control over what people will do for $250k.  I see a ton of wonderful things happening here but also see how the 1% of people could really hurt the reputation of Nouns IRL via some dumb ploy to get Mr. Beasts attention.

However, I think what Noun40 said in his reason sums up where I have landed, in framing this as a “very ambitious rather than a greedy proposal. As he points out, the ETH will not be earmarked for retroactive development, but rather paid forward to the new DAO to drive new nounish proliferation.   So, while I would have preferred a smaller ask or a stream for risk management reasons, I do think Zora has proven their alignment (by purchasing 20 Nouns and building free infra for the DAO) and I think we should take a chance and afford them this ambitious mandate to match and magnify the impact of Prop House on the ecosystem.   Over the past week, I have heard of at least 6-7 people anecdotally in my circles with plans to use the builder imminently for various projects and I think it can play a really important role as a 1-click-align-with-nouns tool, especially when paired with Prop House mandates and strategic builder funding going forward.  I also want to say that I think the future success of the DAO depends greatly on allocating funds to a bigger number of trusted groups, who can do more targeted allocation than the DAO as a whole can do with on-chain proposals alone. This is what makes flexible pools like NSFW important. Its what makes Prop House so damn effective. Its what makes The Noun Square contests and challenges so Ev+. And so likewise, I think (hope) that having a talented, ambitious and fully-aligned team like Zora allocating capital to an even broader pool of builders alongside the above initiatives will hopefully help bring nounish proliferation to the next level.

At the same time, the new Nouns Builder DAO would have a risk of fund extraction. Even though a veto power exists, this power comes with a coordination cost if secured correctly. Having a large imbalance between the auction proceeds and the DAOs treasury early on in the process feels dangerous to me.  Id be amenable if this were a smaller initial seed, the NounsDAO were to follow on by amplifying proposals/prop-house rounds/grant pools/etc. after the Nouns Builder DAO is formed, or the NounsDAO were to purchase Nouns Builder DAO votes during the auction.   9999: Thanks to Zora for effort and dedication to building with Nouns. I’m voting against because I feel this proposal and Builder DAO itself need refinements before an ask of this size. My concerns are these:  If this tool truly needs to be a DAO the market will signal as such using the auction price of its governing NFTs. Just like all other Nounish DAOs, Builder should grow its community and treasury from natural demand and develop its ecosystem with people who understand its vision.  If the tool is not meant to be a DAO, then with no proven track-record, the ask for 1000ETH to jump-start demand is overkill. All other large scale, long-term projects/pods have started small and demonstrated demand before asking for outsized funding (See [Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/prop-house-protocol-public-infrastructure-by-nouns-dao/1594) as cited in this proposal). Builder currently has no metrics to match the size of this ask.  The Zora team should decide which approach to take. If the former, it doesn’t make sense to come to Nouns DAO for a treasury injection. If the latter, the project should first gather momentum before an ask of this size can be considered a hell yes.

This is a free open source protocol they are committing to building that would directly help proliferate nouns. They have put in 4 months of their product development time already + 100 ETH to the code audit and are NOT asking to be retroactively compensated for their dev costs but rather for a commensurate commitment from us to help fund an endowment of this public good. The funding will go to further build and proliferate the protocol. They are financially aligned with nouns by owning 20 nouns themselves. This is a fair, well-aligned, ambitiously nounish situation, and I wholeheartedly vote FOR. "

I believe that Builder DAO should use their own tool, launch their own DAO, and raise the funds via their own daily auction.  Have more faith in the tool, the protocol, etc., and lead by example.  Presumably, every other DAO that launches with this tool will attempt to raise the majority of their capital via the auctions just as the OG Nouns DAO has done. So it seems odd to me that the DAO governing the tool is circumventing the mechanic their own tool provides to raise the majority of their capital.  Even something like Auction #1 going to Nouns DAO for 1000 ETH sits better with me than just sending the 1000 ETH over.  ⌐◨-◨"

Already, Purple DAO has proliferated the Nounish meme to a new community focused on an entirely different mission, and I expect many more of these to come.  1000 ETH is without a doubt a big ask, but if anything, the size makes more more excited than not – especially given the fact that its used to fund the Builders DAO vs retro-paying the Zora team.  As Nouns DAO gets bigger, we must also scale up the size of our bets in order to keep having meaningful impact relative to our size– and I can think of no better team than Zora to carry out such an initiative."

Is it a crazy amount of $? yeah but I think this is an insane value. I changed my vote to NO but its truly just because of the ask. If we can get this prop revised to a better place, Ill be a yes again. Best scenario would be funding distributed over time and/or tied to milestones.  **Sidenoun** I think the ask is of a significant amount. I’m clearly not alone in thinking so. As a developer, I’m very appreciative of the work that goes into any project, let alone one  that has this type of deliverable. The ZORA team are of course a team that I’d vote for. However, that said and with some of the comments on the Nouncil call regarding the hefty request. I think, it’d make some sense to potentially gradually retrospectively reward as we see the success of the protocol roll out to more DAO’s. I can’t cite who made the comment regarding marketing, but I feel that’s probably something that this prop is missing in terms of information. Not just for Nouns, but for those opting to use it.  **systemdm.⌐◨-◨** I think this is an amazing Change the world kind of thing!!! ✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻  **andrewladdusaw** Im shocked at how confident I feel in this 1000 ETH ask. Jacob is a thought leader in the entire space. Zora is one of the premier orgs in the space. They are already heavily invested with 20 Nouns of their own. They have already delivered the product on their own dime. PLUS, this is not a retro reward, its funding a DAO with the goal of furthering the incredible work thats already been done.   Im trying not to speak in hyperbole here, but I think this has the potential to be a really special thing, not just for Nouns, but the future of crypto.  Im still not 100% on where I land on this. All my previous comments still stand on my belief in the tool and the team. I still think its going to be  game changer. I originally told them I thought a huge retro should be offered for a free tool, but that amount in my mind was like 250. When you factor the audit costs they referenced as well, Id be closer to 350-400. Admittedly, I have no idea what things cost in the tech world, but Id like to see this ask be 40-50% of what it is now with Nouns supporting it further later on if its found to be providing outsized value.  **kerimbonia** nothing more to add to whats already been said but this proposal is dope on so many levels (beyond just nouns) and bullish af!  **XIN** Huge ask but huge project and the team is great and have extensive experience making projects and delivering Software and art is the best things to fund imo with the endless amount of reach they can have and this seems amazing Im heavily leaning on a yes vote but i dont see anything about the code being open source or what license they will publish it with? Hopefully gpl or even better agpl  **Juan ⌐◨-◨** Would love to see some traction or more details on how they would deploy the capital (criteria, vetting, etc), seems a little too much like a blank check. Leaning towards a no vote with the hopes of becoming a yes when there is more traction or more details available. 100E-250E Im starting to look at this like a Pod now for something large scale like this I think that would be an appropriate range, with follow-on funding earmarked based on actual performance and other metrics that could be determined appropriately by the DAO  **H O N K D I D D L Y** Plenty of forks exist, this tool is only to bring the lowest effort forks into being. This will bring little to no new builders.   Prop house is MUCH higher ROI.  Further, Zora got $50M to build tooling - they should be seeking subscriptions for their tools, not one-offs.  ___  Enjoy reading this discussion? Learn more here: nouncil.wtf"

Yes, its a lot of money but the overall structure of the proposal is vague and not exciting on paper.  I think a proposal this large (if it has the votes internally or not) should help with making the community understand what they are doing and why its exciting.  There are numerous ways to do this via videos, spaces, interviews or AMA in a Discord etc.    The other thing I would have liked to see is a smaller ask up front with benchmarks and timeline for additional funding periods.  This is going to pass and I am actually excited to see the potential outward proliferation here, would like to see others in the community excited as well via a communicative proposal layout with community engagement ❤️  #Ugly"

Many builders, myself included, probably would never have found our home in nouns without it, and I think a builder-forward group of nouns-passionate individuals, governing and sharing ideas together is a really special thing that shouldnt be underestimated.   Looking back on the past 7 months of Nouns DAO governance, I think youll also find that the majority or fruitful discussion about Proposals, thoughtful vote reasons, and help/feedback provided to Proposers, all came out of Nouncil.   The Permissionless grants program was a really unique idea (h/t Joel) that inspired tonnes of proliferation projects that took all kinds of forms (see our summary thread about it here: https://twitter.com/nouncil/status/1571956714915733504?s=20&t=b7l9UaOXAyXfw1UUPWSJ0g.) I think a further experimentations with this model (of empowering builders who have proven they care about the DAO and the community) are worth funding.   Also, Nouncil administrators have been running the day to day operations for most of Q3 unfunded, so this Proposal is part retro reward, part current operating budget, and part runway to continue to build and grow in Q1 2023.

In my opinion, that means that the 2 noun minimum is probably unnecessarily disenfranchising people who want to be active in the DAO. We dont yet have a problem with spam, and noun ownership is still a lofty bar (nobody is spending 50 ETH for the lulz), so I support lowering the threshold to 1 noun for now. This can always be revisited in future, if and when an over-concentration of low quality proposals becomes a problem.   I think it is much more likely that a good proposal will not make it on chain due to the threshold being 2, than a bad prop will make it on chain because the threshold is only 1."

If you can’t get 2 Nouns then maybe not ready to go on-chain imho.  **JoelCares** A 1 Noun threshold to submit proposals for the first 1000 Nouns feel reasonable to me.  **andreitr** The existing threshold is a feature that reduces noise.  **fiveoceans_dev** I also, agree to keep the threshold growing. It will make smaller stake holders to work together and in turn help coordinate against potential malicious activities by individual big stake holders  **kerimbonia** Also in agreement that lowering the threshold will introduce more noise and with all the changes going on in the nouns ecosystem im not sure this is the best time for it.  **mintface.eth** I lean towards a single Noun so that proposals get seen and evaluated.  2 Nouns min creates a three party negotiation to take something on-chain. Two parties are then seen to endorse or at a min be associated with proposer. The idea of acquire a Noun and propose is cool.  **CHEFFO ⌐◧-◧** i think that the current system is healthy and not needing a change  **samellis ⌐◨-◨** Drop the threshold, good ideas will rise, especially with the changes of gas reimbursement and the more than likely time extension, why put an additional “pay to play” barrier. Let folks come in with their ideas.  **Benbodhi** Only just over a year until it would increase again. The barrier to entry to buy a noun is significant and the ability to submit a prop after purchasing a noun is something I feel should be possible. I know delegation and sponsorship is a thing, but I’m thinking of lone actors. Not sure it makes a huge difference in prop quality.  **Toady_Hawk** I agree with reducing to one noun threshold. We don’t have a proposal spam problem yet (which is why this feature was baked in) so I think it makes sense to lower it to encourage more participation. Last time this was proposed (with a long time period attached that muddied the waters) it was all the brand new Nouners voting yes, which I think was telling. Keep in mind if spam ever became a problem, another proposal could easily raise the threshold again.  **lil bk** all in favor of reducing the threshold to propose. entry of barrier to hold a noun is high as is.   there’s a total of 292 unique noun owners and thus don’t think spam would be an issue. instead, it’ll increase the overall probability to proliferate/propose in the first place. if my counting is correct, there theoretically is only 58 people who can propose as it stands (holding 2 nouns)  **kerimbonia** im on the fence with this one but starting to lean towards yes the more we chat about it.  i def agree that anybody buying a noun should be able to put a proposal on-chain and that the cream of proposals will always rise to the top... that might sway my vote (no) concerning added noise to proposals and the additional time investment needed for voters/nouncil to discuss and filter through all of those to give each one the attention they deserve to get. i also think there is something very community about somebody with a noun having to reach out to another to get a proposal on-chain... anyways, still thinking about all this."

I also am not sure if 1M is that great on TikTok, with their creator fund when you hit 1M views you can make $20-$40, if the platform puts that low a price of value on those views why would we spend so much?  **profwerder ⌐◨-◨ FloriNouns** Unfortunately this is a no from me. I just don’t think the feedback was incorporated and the ask is too high But I love nouns News and hope they continue!"

If we ask for attention, what are we giving in return? What meaning are we impressing on people? Without considering these things and just contiuning to be around we will fail to make the kind of impact we want. Not a huge harm, but were sending the wrong signal to builders about what we need.   Additionally this prop is lacking crucial details about what imagery actually appears and how. I think if the DAO ever funds image based advertising again it should either include mockups or proofs that both give clarity of what were getting, and to instill confidence that the team can represent the brand in a high quality manner (unless perhaps the builder/artist has such an awesome reputation that)."

Proposal 155,Supported By,0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87ff6034fc032d4722,1.0,"John David McAfee (/ˈmækəfiː/ MAK-ə-fee;[1][2] 18 September 1945 – 23 June 2021)[3][4] was a British-American computer programmer, businessman, and two-time presidential candidate who unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination for president of the United States in 2016 and in 2020. In 1987, he wrote the first commercial anti-virus software, founding McAfee Associates to sell his creation. He resigned in 1994 and sold his remaining stake in the company.[5] McAfee became the companys most vocal critic in later years, urging consumers to uninstall the companys anti-virus software, which he characterized as bloatware. He disavowed the companys continued use of his name in branding, a practice that has persisted in spite of a short-lived corporate rebrand attempt under Intel ownership.  McAfees fortunes plummeted in the financial crisis of 2007–2008. After leaving McAfee Associates, he founded the companies Tribal Voice (makers of the PowWow chat program), QuorumEx, and Future Tense Central, among others, and was involved in leadership positions in the companies Everykey, MGT Capital Investments, and Luxcore, among others. His personal and business interests included smartphone apps, cryptocurrency, yoga, light-sport aircraft[6] and recreational drug use. He resided for a number of years in Belize, but returned to the United States in 2013 while wanted in Belize for questioning on suspicion of murder.[7]  In October 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain over U.S. tax evasion charges.[8] U.S. federal prosecutors brought criminal and civil charges alleging that McAfee had failed to file income taxes over a four-year period.[9][10] On 23 June 2021, he was found dead due to an apparent suicide by hanging in his prison cell near Barcelona shortly after the Spanish National Court authorized his extradition to the U.S.[11][12][13] His death generated speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered.[14] McAfees wife, Janice McAfee, said she did not believe McAfee committed suicide, and claimed the suicide note was a forgery.[15][16]  McAfee was born in Cinderford, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England,[17] on 18 September 1945,[18] on a U.S. Army base (of the 596th Ordnance Ammunition Company), to an American father, Don McAfee, who was stationed there, and a British mother, Joan (Williams).[19][20] His father was from Roanoke, Virginia, and McAfee was himself primarily raised in Salem, Virginia, United States. He said he felt as much British as American.[21] When he was 15, his father, whom a BBC columnist described as an abusive alcoholic, killed himself with a gun.[21] He had spent his childhood living in fear that a beating from his father could happen at any time, and struggled to make sense of why this was happening to him.[18]  McAfee received a bachelors degree in mathematics in 1967 from Roanoke College in Virginia, which subsequently awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 2008.[22] After receiving his bachelors degree, McAfee began working towards a doctorate in mathematics at Northeast Louisiana State College but was expelled, in about 1968, because of a relationship with an undergraduate student, who became his first wife.[23]  McAfee was employed as a programmer by NASAs Institute for Space Studies in New York City from 1968 to 1970 working on the Apollo program. From there, he went to Univac as a software designer, and later to Xerox as an operating system architect. In 1978, he joined Computer Sciences Corporation as a software consultant. He worked for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton from 1980 to 1982.[24] In 1986, while employed by Lockheed, he read about the Brain computer virus made for the PC, and he found it terrifying.[23] Sensing a business opportunity, he went about creating an antivirus software that could detect the computer virus and remove it automatically.[20] In 1987 McAfee created McAfee Associates Inc. to sell this software, which he named VirusScan.[22] This was the first anti-virus software brought to market, and one of the first software products to be distributed over the Internet.[20][22]  Initially McAfee did not seek a large userbase of paying users, but rather wanted to raise awareness of the need to be protected from computer viruses. However, by making people fear such malware, he managed to generate millions of sales, and by 1990 he was making five million dollars a year.[18] The company was incorporated in Delaware in 1992, and had its initial public offering the same year. In August 1993, McAfee stepped down as chief executive and remained with the company as the chief technical officer. He was succeeded by Bill Larson.[25] In 1994 he sold his remaining stake in the company.[26] He had no further involvement in its operations.[5]  After various mergers and ownership changes, Intel acquired McAfee in August 2010.[27] In January 2014, Intel announced that McAfee-related products would be marketed as Intel Security. McAfee expressed his pleasure at the name change, saying, I am now everlastingly grateful to Intel for freeing me from this terrible association with the worst software on the planet.[28] The business was soon de-merged from Intel, once more under the McAfee name.  Other business ventures that were founded by McAfee include Tribal Voice, which developed one of the first instant messaging programs,[29] PowWow. In 2000, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Zone Labs, makers of firewall software, prior to its acquisition by Check Point Software in 2003.[30]  In the 2000s McAfee invested in and advertised ultra-light flights, which he marketed as aerotrekking.[6]  In August 2009 The New York Times reported that McAfees personal fortune had declined to $4 million from a peak of $100 million due to the effect of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 on his investments.[26]  In 2009, McAfee was interviewed in Belize for the CNBC special The Bubble Decade, in which it was reported that he had invested in and/or built many mansions in the USA that went unsold when the 2007 global recession hit. The report also discussed his quest to raise plants for possible medicinal uses on his land in Belize.[31]  In February 2010, McAfee started the company QuorumEx,[32] headquartered in Belize, which aimed to produce herbal antibiotics that disrupt quorum sensing in bacteria.[33][34]  In June 2013, McAfee uploaded a parody video titled How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus onto his YouTube channel. In it, he critiques the antivirus software while snorting white powder and being stripped by scantily clad women. It received ten million views. He told Reuters the video was meant to ridicule the medias negative coverage of him. A spokesman for McAfee Inc. called the videos statements ludicrous.[35]  Also in 2013, McAfee founded Future Tense Central, which aimed to produce a secure computer network device called the D-Central.[36] By 2016, it was also an incubator.[37]  In February 2014, McAfee announced Cognizant, an application for smartphones, which displays information about the permissions of other installed applications.[38] In April 2014, it was renamed DCentral 1, and an Android version was released for free on Google Play.[39][40]   McAfee at DEF CON 2015 At the DEF CON conference in Las Vegas in August 2014, McAfee warned people not to use smartphones, suggesting apps are used to spy on clueless consumers who do not read privacy user agreements.[41] In January 2016, he became the chief evangelist for security startup Everykey.[37]  In February 2016, McAfee publicly volunteered to decrypt the iPhone used by Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik in San Bernardino, avoiding the need for Apple to build a backdoor.[42] He later admitted that his claims regarding the ease of cracking the phone were a publicity stunt, while still asserting its possibility.[43]  In May 2016, McAfee was appointed chairman and CEO of MGT Capital Investments, a technology holding company. It initially said it would rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies,[44] although this plan was abandoned due to a dispute with Intel over rights to the McAfee name.[45] He changed MGTs focus from social gaming to cybersecurity, saying anti-virus software is dead, it no longer works, and that the new paradigm has to stop the hacker getting in before he or she can do damage.[46]  Soon after joining MGT, McAfee said he and his team had exploited a flaw in the Android operating system that allowed him to read encrypted messages from WhatsApp.[47] Gizmodo investigated his claim, and reported that he had sent reporters malware-infected phones to make this hack work. He replied: Of course the phones had malware on them. How that malware got there is the story, which we will release after speaking with Google. It involves a serious flaw in the Android architecture.[48]  McAfee moved MGT into the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, both to make money for the company, and to increase MGTs expertise in dealing with blockchains, which he thought was important for cybersecurity.[49]  In August 2017, McAfee stepped down as CEO, instead serving as MGTs chief cybersecurity visionary. In January 2018, he left the company altogether. Both sides said the split was amicable; he said he wanted to spend all of his time on cryptocurrencies, while the company told of pressure from potential investors to disassociate itself from him.[50]  On 13 August 2018, McAfee took a position of CEO with Luxcore, a cryptocurrency company focused on enterprise solutions.[51]  McAfee was a libertarian, advocating the decriminalization of cannabis, an end to the war on drugs, non-interventionism in foreign policy, a free market economy which does not redistribute wealth, and upholding free trade. He supported abolishing the Transportation Security Administration.[52]  McAfee advocated increased cyber awareness and more action against the threat of cyberwarfare.[53] He pushed religious liberty, saying that business owners should be able to deny service in circumstances that contradict their religious beliefs, adding: No one is forcing you to buy anything or to choose one person over another. So why should I be forced to do anything if I am not harming you? Its my choice to sell, your choice to buy.[54]  On 8 September 2015, McAfee announced a bid for president of the United States in the 2016 presidential election, as the candidate of a newly formed political party called the Cyber Party.[19][55] On 24 December 2015, he re-announced his candidacy bid saying that he would instead seek the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party.[37][56] On the campaign trail, he consistently polled alongside the partys other top candidates, Gary Johnson and Austin Petersen.[57] The three partook in the Libertarian Partys first nationally televised presidential debate on 29 March 2016.[58] His running mate was photographer, commercial real estate broker and Libertarian activist Judd Weiss.[59]  McAfee came in second in the primaries[60] and third at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention.[61]  Contrary to his assertion at the 2016 convention, McAfee tweeted on 3 June 2018 that he would run for president again in 2020, either with the Libertarian Party or a separate party that he would create.[65] He later chose to run as a Libertarian.[66] He mainly campaigned for wider cryptocurrency use.  On 22 January 2019, McAfee tweeted that he would continue his campaign in exile, following reports that he, his wife, and four campaign staff were indicted for tax-related felonies by the IRS. He said he was in international waters, and had previously tweeted that he was going to Venezuela.[67] The IRS has not commented on the alleged indictments.[68] He defended Communist revolutionary Che Guevara on Twitter, putting himself at odds with Libertarian National Committee chairman Nicholas Sarwark, who wrote, I hear very little buzz about McAfee this time around ... making a defense of Che Guevara from Cuba may ingratiate him with the Cuban government, but it didnt resonate well with Libertarians.[69]  In a tweet on 4 March 2020, McAfee simultaneously suspended his 2020 presidential campaign, endorsed Vermin Supreme, and announced his campaign for the Libertarian Party vice presidential nomination.[70] The next day, he returned to the presidential field, reversing the suspension of his bid, as No one in the Libertarian Party Would consider me For Vice President.[71] The next month, he endorsed Adam Kokesh and became Kokeshs vice-presidential candidate, while still seeking the presidency for himself.[72] At the 2020 Libertarian National Convention, he again lost, now to Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen for the presidential and vice-presidential slots.[73]  McAfee contended that taxes were illegal, and claimed in 2019 that he had not filed a tax return since 2010. He referred to himself as a prime target of the Internal Revenue Service.[74]  In July 2017, McAfee predicted on Twitter that the price of a bitcoin would jump to $500,000 within three years, adding: If not, I will eat my own dick on national television.[75] In July 2019, he predicted a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.[76] In January 2020, he tweeted that his predictions were a ruse to onboard new users, and that bitcoin had limited potential because it is an ancient technology.[77]  McAfee was named a defendant in a 2008 civil court case related to his Aerotrekking light-sport aircraft venture and the death of nephew Joel Bitow and a passenger.[78]  On 30 April 2012, McAfees property in Orange Walk Town, Belize, was raided by the Gang Suppression Unit of the Belize Police Department. A GSU press release said he was arrested for unlicensed drug manufacturing and possession of an unlicensed weapon.[34][79][80] He was released without charge.[81]  In 2012, Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez confirmed that McAfee was neither convicted nor charged, only suspected.[82]  In January 2014, while in Canada, he said that when the Belizean government raided his property, it seized his assets, and that his house later burned down under suspicious circumstances.[83]  On 2 August 2015, McAfee was arrested in Henderson County, Tennessee, on one count of driving under the influence and one count of possession of a firearm while intoxicated.[84]  In July 2019, McAfee and members of his entourage were arrested while his yacht was docked at Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, on suspicion of carrying high-caliber weapons and ammunition. They were held for four days and released.[85] Weapons were seized, according to the Public Ministry.[86]  On 11 August 2020, McAfee falsely stated that he was arrested in Norway during the COVID-19 pandemic after refusing to replace a lace thong with a more effective face mask. He later tweeted a picture of himself with a bruised eye, claiming it occurred during this arrest.[87] The photo of the alleged arrest shows an officer with the German word for police on his uniform, invalidating McAfees claim of having been arrested in Norway. The Augsburg police later said he tried to enter Germany on that day, but was not arrested.[88]  On 12 November 2012, Belize police began to search for McAfee as a person of interest in connection to the homicide investigation of American expatriate Gregory Viant Faull, who was found dead of a gunshot wound the day before, at his home on the island of Ambergris Caye, the largest island in Belize.[89][90] Faull was a neighbor of McAfees.[91] In a contemporary interview with Wired,[92] McAfee said he had been afraid police would kill him and refused their routine questions and evaded them.[91] He buried himself in sand for several hours with a cardboard box over his head.[18] Belizes prime minister, Dean Barrow, called him extremely paranoid, even bonkers.[93] He fled Belize rather than cooperate.[94][95][96]  In December 2012, the magazine Vice accidentally gave away McAfees location at a Guatemalan resort, when a photo taken by one of its journalists accompanying him was posted with the EXIF geolocation metadata still attached.[97]  While in Guatemala, McAfee asked Chad Essley, an American cartoonist and animator, to set up a blog so he could write about his experience while on the run.[98] He then appeared publicly in Guatemala City, where he unsuccessfully sought political asylum.[99]  On 5 December 2012, he was arrested for illegally entering Guatemala. Shortly afterward, the board reviewing his asylum plea denied it and he was taken to a detention center to await deportation to Belize.[100]  On 6 December 2012, Reuters and ABC News reported that McAfee had two minor heart attacks in the detention center and was hospitalized.[101][102] His lawyer said he had no heart attacks, rather high blood pressure and anxiety attacks.[103][104][105] McAfee later said he faked the heart attacks to buy time for his attorney to file a series of appeals that ultimately prevented his deportation to Belize, thus hastening that governments decision to send him back to the United States.[106]  On 12 December 2012, McAfee was released and deported to the United States.[107]  On 14 November 2018, the Circuit Court in Orlando, Florida, refused to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit against him for Faulls death.[108][109]  In January 2019, McAfee announced that he was on the run from U.S. authorities, and living internationally on a boat following the convening of a grand jury to indict him, his wife, and four of his 2020 Libertarian Party presidential primaries staff on tax evasion charges.[110] At the time, the Internal Revenue Service had not independently confirmed the existence of any such indictment.[110]  On 5 October 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain at the request of the United States Department of Justice for tax evasion. The June indictment, which was unsealed upon his arrest, alleged he earned millions of dollars from 2014 to 2018, and failed to file income tax returns.[111]  On 6 October, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint further alleging McAfee and his bodyguard promoted certain initial coin offerings (ICOs) in a fraudulent cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme.[112] It claims he presented himself as an impartial investor when he promoted the ICOs, despite allegedly getting paid $23 million in digital assets in return.[112]  On 5 March 2021, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York formally indicted him and an executive adviser on these charges.[113]  McAfee was jailed in Spain, pending extradition to the United States.[113][114]  On 23 June 2021, the Spanish National Court authorized his extradition to face charges in Tennessee;[115][5] McAfee is suspected to have committed suicide several hours after the authorization. The New York extradition case was still pending in a lower Spanish court.[5]  McAfee married three times. He met his first wife circa 1968 while he was working towards a doctorate at Northeast Louisiana State College and she was an undergraduate student.[23] Their affair led to his expulsion from the college.[23] He married his second wife, Judy, a former flight attendant at American Airlines, circa 1987; they divorced in 2002.[23] The night after McAfee arrived in the United States after being deported from Guatemala in December 2012, he was solicited by and slept with Janice Dyson, then a sex worker 30 years his junior in South Beach, Miami Beach, Florida.[116] They began a relationship and married in 2013.[117] She claims that he saved her from human traffickers.[18]  The couple moved to Portland, Oregon, in 2013.[118]  In a 2012 article in Mensa Bulletin, the magazine of the American Mensa, McAfee said developing the first commercial antivirus program had made him the most popular hacking target and [h]ackers see hacking me as a badge of honor. For his own cybersecurity, he said he had other people buy his computer equipment for him, used pseudonyms for setting up computers and logins, and changed his IP address several times a day.[119] When asked on another occasion if he personally used McAfees antivirus software, he replied: I take it off[...]its too annoying.[120]  In 2015, he resided in Lexington, Tennessee.[84] In December 2018, he tweeted that he has 47 genetic children.[121][122][123][124] His third wife described him in a Fathers Day message as father of many, loved by few.[18]  On 23 June 2021, McAfee was found dead in his prison cell at the Brians 2 Penitentiary Center [ca] near Barcelona, hours after the Spanish National Court ordered his extradition to the United States on criminal charges filed in Tennessee by the United States Department of Justice Tax Division.[5] The Catalan Justice Department said everything indicates he killed himself by hanging.[11][125][126][127] An official autopsy confirmed his suicide.[128][13]  McAfees death ignited speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered. McAfees death drew comparisons to the circumstances of the death of American financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.[129][130] Several times, McAfee claimed if he were ever found dead by hanging, it would mean he was murdered.[131] Minutes after the report of his death, an image of the letter Q was posted to his Instagram feed (his account was subsequently taken down), apparently in reference to QAnon conspiracy theories.[132][133][134] These theories have been referred to by some journalists as speculative, bizarre, and baseless, primarily based on McAfees own statements.[132][133][134] The day after his death, his lawyer told reporters that while he regularly maintained contact with McAfee in prison, there were no signs of suicidal intent.[135] McAfees widow reaffirmed this position in her first public remarks since her husbands death, and also called for a thorough investigation.[136][137]  On 13 February 2022, a Spanish court ruled McAfee died by suicide.[138]  In a Netflix documentary released on August 24, 2022, entitled Running With the Devil: The Wild World of John McAfee, McAfees ex-girlfriend, identified as Samantha Herrera, alleged that McAfee faked his death to avoid tax evasion charges. This allegation has not been proven, however.[139][140]  Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee is a Showtime Networks documentary about the portion of McAfees life spent in Belize. It began airing in September 2016.[141] It covers allegations against him of raping his former business partner, Allison Adonizio, and murdering Belizean David Middleton and American expat Gregory Faull.[142][143] In an interview with Bloombergs Pimm Fox and Kathleen Hayes on 8 September 2016, he said these incidents were fabricated, and Belize is a third-world banana republic and you can go down there and make any story you want if you pay your interviewees, which Showtime did.[144][145]  In March 2017, it was reported that Glenn Ficarra and John Requa would direct a film about McAfee titled King of the Jungle, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. At various points, Johnny Depp, Michael Keaton, and Seth Rogen were reported to have taken roles and later to have left the project. In November 2019, Zac Efron was reported to star as journalist Ari Furman.[146][147][148][149]  On 12 May 2017, McAfee and his wife were interviewed on ABC Newss 20/20 regarding Faulls alleged murder.[150]  The aforementioned documentary Running With the Devil: The Wild World of John McAfee includes footage from an unreleased documentary by Vice, and interviews by Rocco Castoro, Alex Cody Foster, and Robert King.[151]  "

The potential for increased participation in governance is a clear benefit and empowering people to showcase their desire to be a delegate with incentives on the way is an interesting approach."

The discretion of the current group has proven to be more than successful so far imo.  I also agree with the conversation around additional members being added and a general discussion about other potential pods. OTG hopes to be more pod like in its next iteration. Thank you NSFW, 22 and the other members who give their time daily to field every single builder request that comes through Discourse and Discord."

I do however agree with the Nounders that it needs to be more decentralized with multiple voices.   This does not mean that anyone has done a bad job.   However, moving NSFW into a more decentralized pod with more participants that are anxiously engaged in voicing their opinions and impacting outcomes has a great deal of merit, this will also support 22 in his efforts so that all of the burdens dont fall solely on his shoulders as it is a lot of work liaising with all of the different requests.  I am not voting against this proposal, because I know of all the good that can come out of this program for both the receivers of the rewards and the DAO, however, I would be a hell yes if this was a proposal that also included a full-time group/POD working on NSFW, sharing their knowledge, streamlining the process, coming up with more standardized rewards, and having the rewards/outcomes be more publicized across social media."

So far, the use of funds has been productive for the ecosystem, however were concerned that the level of accountability and transparency has not scaled with the amount of funding it has received.  Pods should operate as minimum viable decentralized entities, with multiple members who are voicing opinions and having an impact on outcomes. NSFW is currently not structured this way. We want to ensure community projects get the benefit of a diversity of opinions and will vote to fund NSFW when there are multiple members actively involved with making decisions."

Another example would be Jhee, a talented artist from Korea who won a contest on The Noun Square. Benbodhi then connected her to nsfw and she was funded to launch a nounish collection as a result. I could cite many other examples, but the point is: I believe flexible and nimble capital is an important tool for the DAO. I also think 22 is a very committed and hard-working contributor who does a very good job of combing through discourse and DMs to find solid proposals to fund.   Having said all of the above, I think more transparency with the day-to-day decision making of the pod would be good for the DAO generally.  I also think that it could be a real unlock for nsfw if they were to explore empowering some focused sub-pods with ETH to help further decentralize the burden of uncovering and vetting fund-worthy projects. Eg. pods for different geographic areas or niche types of proposal. Happy to help brainstorm on this concept further with 22 if interested. "

However, im voting against based on a perceived lack of transparency and decentralization.  When it comes to DAO operations, there is an obvious tension between speed/efficiency and decentralization. The tradeoffs on either side of this spectrum are very real and often hard to grapple with. Im mindful of that.  But for a pod like this, theres a minimum level of decentralization that should be maintained, and its not clear to me if that is currently being met.  Whether intentional or due to gravitational forces of path of least resistance, my perception is that NSFW currently errs too much on the side of efficiency.   Ive given this considerable thought and am aware of the tradeoffs, but ultimately think its better for the daos longterm health and culture to push back and check itself in favor of preserving a high integrity re decentralization. Instead of simply refilling the wallet, I think its prudent to ask the dao how they think this role should be operated.  I will vote For a proposal of this kind with a 3/5 multisig, a public channel of communication, and ideally a diverse set of (active) signers of different backgrounds and expertise to make sure we cover the full range of ideas and builders who seek retro funding/grants."

It went through some changes over time however, and is imbalanced in terms of responsibility now. I am afraid if we continue increasing the pool size without scaling it into a small grants / NSFW pod that we concentrate too much power into the hands of an individual. It seems like a pod but it isn’t one. The DAO only compensates one person for it. Small grants needs a structural change to share the burden of responsibility and to mitigate risks. For a healthy future of the DAO we need to have a pod also to protect the DAO against black swan events. With more shared responsibility we can mitigate risks and distribute the burden of work load in a fair way. I would welcome it if we could have a discussion about this topic before we continue with this prop as it drew already quite some controversy."

(50 yes, 1 no, 7 abstain, 1 x)   ~~ ThaSwami ~~ I think its great to reward everyone who submitted traits, but Coordinape voting might be overkill. Im of the view that anyone who took the time to contribute some art should get rewarded, irrespective of how many they submitted, quality of work or who they interacted with. Im in favour of a simple pro-rata of ETH amongst the number of artists. We could setup clearer guidelines for rewards next season   ~~ JoelCares ~~  Personally think this would be fun, help build community across the broad group of participants, and give the community a voice in evaluating quality. The current structure (3 GIVE tokens) would not be rewarding general participation, it would be rewarding the runner up work valued most by the community."

Music tends to get ignored sometimes in this space, relative to other kinds of art, and it’s a shame. Woody is a Grammy-winning producer and imho Nouns is lucky to have someone as talented and passionate as him who is interested to create a music platform like this for our community.

This will allow creators of many mediums and networks to create and use sounds made with the CC0 assets that will create a nounish vibe when you hear them. The consistency across media will surely provide a recognisable sound profile that will benefit the ecosystem. I already know of a lot of media and creators that will be able to leverage this out of the gate. ⌐◨-◨

This is great on so many levels, presentation is spoot on and the concept is excellent  Nothing but positivity about this proposal can be found anywhere in Nouncil channels. Woody has been a fixture in nouncil and in nouns for the past 7+ months has brought so much joy with his musical and production skills (Nouncil theme song, Woodys Soundboard, etc.)   A soundscape / sonic aesthetic is important for any brand and nobody had tried to do one for nouns yet, so it feels like a no-brainer to give the Grammy-nominated noun-pilled a producer to blow our minds.

Each ball should measure approximately 3 tablespoons in volume, and you should be able to fit 6 to 8 balls on each sheet.

Proposal 134,Supported By,0x4e142fe48c71092e78be1f1082fa8ce0cb15c354,1.0,"i feel strongly about supporting this. seems like the 26 year time period is throwing people off. it can be changed via another proposal but I see this as a default safeguard against  centralizing power into the hands of only those who own or are delegated many nouns. right now there shouldnt be any difference in power (besides # of votes) between those with 1 noun and those with many nouns. anyone with a noun should be able to submit a proposal to the DAO. And we can assume (at this point) anyone putting up the capital to buy a noun will come with a thoughtful proposal. If one nouners are required to find someone else to co-sign a proposal then theres not much difference between having a noun and not having a noun.   If we wanted to change the threshold at a later date it would require thoughtful consideration and discussion, rather than continuing to kick the can down the road and lowering the threshold every few months."

I think the 26 years piece muddied the waters on this proposal unnecessarily, but ultimately the threshold could be raised at any point in the future and I feel like solving this problem later, when the problem actually exists, makes more sense to me than the inverse. If this proposal should fail, hopefully an alternative for a shorter period of time will be more palatable to the DAO. "

Proposal 130,Supported By,0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87ff6034fc032d4722,1.0,"Judge: The defense may proceed.  Roark: Your Honor, I shall call no witnesses. This will be my testimony and my summation.  Judge: Take the oath.  Court Clerk: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?  Roark: I do.  Thousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light, but he left them a gift they had not conceived, and he lifted darkness off the earth.  Throughout the centuries, there were men who took first steps down new roads, armed with nothing but their own vision. The great creators -- the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors -- stood alone against the men of their time. Every new thought was opposed; every new invention was denounced. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered, and they paid. But they won.  No creator was prompted by a desire to please his brothers. His brothers hated the gift he offered.  His truth was his only motive.  His work was his only goal.  His work -- not those who used it.  His creation -- not the benefits others derived from it -- the creation which gave form to his truth.  He held his truth above all things and against all men. He went ahead whether others agreed with him or not, with his integrity as his only banner. He served nothing and no one. He lived for himself. And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement. Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. The man who thinks must think and act on his own. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be subordinated to the needs, opinions, or wishes of others. It is not an object of sacrifice.  The creator stands on his own judgment; the parasite follows the opinions of others.  The creator thinks; the parasite copies.  The creator produces; the parasite loots.  The creators concern is the conquest of nature; the parasites concern is the conquest of men.  The creator requires independence. He neither serves nor rules. He deals with men by free exchange and voluntary choice.  The parasite seeks power. He wants to bind all men together in common action and common slavery. He claims that man is only a tool for the use of others -- that he must think as they think, act as they act, and live in selfless, joyless servitude to any need but his own.  Look at history: Everything we have, every great achievement has come from the independent work of some independent mind. Every horror and destruction came from attempts to force men into a herd of brainless, soulless robots -- without personal rights, without person ambition, without will, hope, or dignity.  It is an ancient conflict. It has another name: The individual against the collective.  Our country, the noblest country in the history of men, was based on the principle of individualism, the principle of mans inalienable rights. It was a country where a man was free to seek his own happiness, to gain and produce, not to give up and renounce; to prosper, not to starve; to achieve, not to plunder; to hold as his highest possession a sense of his personal value, and as his highest virtue his self-respect.  Look at the results. That is what the collectivists are now asking you to destroy, as much of the earth has been destroyed.  I am an architect. I know what is to come by the principle on which it is built. We are approaching a world in which I cannot permit myself to live. My ideas are my property. They were taken from me by force, by breach of contract. No appeal was left to me.  It was believed that my work belonged to others, to do with as they pleased. They had a claim upon me without my consent -- that it was my duty to serve them without choice or reward.  Now you know why a dynamited Courtland. I designed Courtland. I made it possible. I destroyed it. I agreed to design it for the purpose of it seeing built as I wished. That was the price I set for my work. I was not paid. My building was disfigured at the whim of others who took all the benefits of my work and gave me nothing in return.  I came here to say that I do not recognize anyones right to one minute of my life, nor to any part of my energy, nor to any achievement of mine -- no matter who makes the claim!  It had to be said: The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing. I came here to be heard in the name of every man of independence still left in the world. I wanted to state my terms. I do not care to work or live on any others.  My terms are: A mans RIGHT to exist for his own sake."

Proposal 127,Opposed By,0xcc2688350d29623e2a0844cc8885f9050f0f6ed5,13.0,"This vote ended up being fairly contentious in Nouncil, with the final tally ending 18 FOR - 27 AGAINST (7 ABSTAIN).  Most of the discussion on the Nouncil weekly call centered around feelings that the proposed garments did not look Nounish, or that the Nounish streetwear category was currently crowded with props such as Madhappy and Nouns Brand already in production.   Overall, Im struggling with the nounishness of this project. Im a no for now, was one comment from our Nouncil Discussion Thread. It seems like a duplicative effort, was another. The generous 15:85 rev split isn’t enough to make up for the lack of Nounish brand experience.    Proponents of the project liked the novel NFT ownership verification, and the Nounish apparel mockups that were released maybe just a little too late to sway the vote (after the team spoke on The Noun Square last night and dropped into Nouncil to show Nounish mockups and clarify some things, a flood of YES votes did come in, but ultimately not enough to win the vote.)   Example comments on the Discussion thread after the TNS appearance and new mockups: Having been sceptical, Ive been really impressed by Dopamine on NoC. I think its taken a while to articulate the scope of the vision, and why its nounish: Community, web3 native, proof of work, tech innovation (and it will be fully noggle branded). Im a yes. And: I am as well. I feel like the concerns have been addressed and this could be a good experiment with digital/physical merch in a new way.   If the team does choose to iterate and reapply, it would be good to make sure those Nounish prototypes are front and center. "

There are tons of jobs and tasks that need to be done daily to make sure the momentum of Nouns doesnt wane, but without talented people who understand the culture and are committed to the longterm success of the DAO, that momentum would slow to a crawl. Noun22 is a person who has does a lot of important core work for the DAO and would be impossible to easily replace. Incentivizing people like him to continue building here is important, so I support his Proposal for this reason. I also think there is lots of opportunity for ongoing DAO tasks to be put into buckets and bid on using Prop House tech in future, to increase decentralization and longterm sustainability, but these two things are not mutually exclusive, and we will nonetheless always need passionate core contributors to drive growth.

This is a weaker prop, for more ETH.  - It leaves a bad taste sponsoring events where Nouns are a part, but not the center of the show. I dislike when Nouns are shown side by side with, imo, questionable projects (MAYC etc) and by extension we end up sponsoring these projects too.  Ultimately I still think this is a pretty easy Yes and will make Nouns known to a new audience."

I believe they can cont to iterate and improve throughout the project - The (seeming) importance of spreading nouns IRL - The opportunity cost  — id rather give this team a chance to prove themselves at the cost of ~1 days auction proceeds. Running this experiment will teach us something. Denying it means standing still.

Project proposers dropped into Nouncil channel to discuss, and argued that CC0 image repositories are inherently Nounish, and this ultimately swayed enough support for a Yes Result. Ser Noadz made a suggestion of tying in some kind of Nounish art contest to make the connection more overt, we hope to see something like this integrated during execution. "
Proposal 94,Supported By,0xd19bf5f0b785c6f1f6228c72a8a31c9f383a49c4,2.0,"The idea is nounish and I support this experiment.   Even though I would much rather see an all-purpose cc0 image repo, I’m trusting that this can be the first step to get the ball rolling for what could, and should, be a bigger endeavor to include many other artists’ work in one place. I think cc0images.wtf was smart vs. tied to space theme.  Lastly, as a photographer, I’m unsure about funding equipment upgrades. The work already seems to be very good and would’ve liked to have seen a breakdown there but kudos for proposing something interesting & beautiful."

Even if the Plaintiffs motivations could be politically motivated, it seems PT may have indeed broken some lottery and/or banking laws in NY, or at least, it is far from a sure thing that they didnt. Moreover, it was mentioned that this should probably have been a planned-for eventuality for such a protocol (to be sued by the State) and Nouncil worries about the precedent of deploying Nouns treasury to fund this kind of predictable legal battle (hat tip Wag.)

Nouns coffee is something that has been talked about a lot and this is the first serious effort to make it happen. We trust the product and branding will be high quality, so for these reasons we are voting Yes. One piece of feedback that did come up during Nouncillor discussion was that we would like to see Proposals (especially those with relatively substantial asks) go up on Discourse for at least a couple days for discussion and feedback before going on chain. This way Nouncil (and the broader Nouns community) has time to ask clarifying questions about budget, success metrics, etc. We are voting YES here in spite of this not having been done in this case, but would encourage future Proposers to consider this route when possible. By the way, we also welcome Proposers to Post their ideas in Nouncil for feedback, or ask to have it added to our weekly call Agenda.  "

Proposal 81,Opposed By,0xa555d1ee16780b2d414ed97f4f169c0740099615,1.0,"It seems that the reason were discussing gifting a noun to an extension project, which is unprecedented (we never discussed a gift nor discount to sharkdao, goop, etc), is that we were allocated 10% of future NFT supply (a new thing that Lil Nouns did). Im voting AGAINST since Im opposed to sending a signal to present and future nouns extensions that we value receiving NFT supply allocation in a special way.  Receiving someone elses NFTs is kind of a headache. Were suddenly put into the position of having to make asset owner decisions (should we hold or sell) and in some cases such as this one we might have added governance responsibilities as well (e.g. have 10% responsibility of lil nouns future). So unless we have some easy DAO level consensus on regularly selling the newly received NFTs, were likely looking at the duties of holding onto an illiquid asset while incurring more DAO governance overhead. One might say that if we start receiving a lot of NFTs this way then some might really pop and have liquid markets and we might be able to experience some real ETH treasury gains through it. But if we really believed in that then we could have always bought new noun extension NFTs as pure investors with our ETH. I believe we have yet to do that because we dont think ourselves as NFT investors (even if the scope is limited to nouns extensions) and dont think that is where we create the most value from our attention.   An arrangement that wed much rather prefer than being gifted NFT supply is a nouns extension buying Nouns with their treasury. In this arrangement, we get ETH and likely some governance participation as well, both things that we really like and no added responsibilities that we dont like.   Im not saying that we should be stingy or completely self centered in a short term way. I think Lil Nouns is a brilliant experiment and love that were for example spinning up a lil nouns prop house and sending ETH their way to help bootstrap builders there, etc. I just think that rewarding NFT supply gifting over other acts such as buying nouns or participating in our governance (which both sharkdao and goop have done) sends the wrong message that is against our incentives. We want extensions to buy Nouns, submit proposals, and participate in our governance! Giving us assets for free can be nice but comparatively is meh. "

We are looking forward to all the challenges Nerman Bot will be able to help solve within Nouns DAO discord (including several applications for Nouncil), as well as the other websites and bots that Joel’s team will build to help proliferate the meme. Nouncil is proud to have sponsored this Proposal (our first, after our own) and we wish Joel luck with the vote, and hopefully soon, with building out all these awesome tools for Nouns."

Proposal 75,Supported By,0xcc2688350d29623e2a0844cc8885f9050f0f6ed5,7.0,"This was probably our most contentious YES vote to date (final tally was 20 votes for, 10 against, 6 abstentions.) Overall, I think the common theme from our discussions on Nouncil call this week was that MadHappy is a great brand, and this potentially represents a great opportunity for Nouns to get positive exposure in the streetwear community. Also, we overall acknowledge that established artists and brands can be afforded a certain baseline of trust to execute on ideas. However, having said that, many Nouncillors expressed concern at the fact that the Proposal included no mockups or design plans, and no Development Phases tied to Milestones. We would like to see, even from established brands, at least some basic mockups to determine whether the designs will be desirable, and/or Nounish. And some Phase Breakdowns, maybe with a design consultation Phase to start, would have made this Proposal more amenable to more Nouncillors (we think.) Were voting FOR, and excited to see the result, but hopefully this feedback is taken to heart by future proposers so that good ideas dont lose votes due to a lack of detail in their on-chain Proposal.

The concern was also voiced that the DAO owning the cars could be a cost/liability after the season (storage, etc.) Overall, we like the energy and the proposal was well written, but the majority voted No this time. We really like Don and his energy and hope he will stick around and build more within Nouns. Kudos to him for seeking lots of discussion on Discourse and holding open calls in the discord to take feedback. We should encourage this kind of builder to stick around. Dom, please build something Nounish, even if its small, so that we can invite you to join Nouncil!"

Proposal 59,Opposed By,0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87ff6034fc032d4722,1.0,"I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself.  Completely.  When I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, was a product of all the fear and humiliation I suffered. Fear of my parents. The humiliation of teachers calling me “garbage can” and telling me I’d be mowing lawns for a living. And the very real terror of my fellow students. I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. I was skinny and clumsy, and when others would tease me I didn’t run home crying, wondering why.  I knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.  I hated myself all the time.  As stupid at it seems now, I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn’t going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you’ll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time.  I didn’t think much of them either.  Then came Mr. Pepperman, my advisor. He was a powerfully built Vietnam veteran, and he was scary. No one ever talked out of turn in his class. Once one kid did and Mr. P. lifted him off the ground and pinned him to the black board. Mr. P. could see that I was in bad shape, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no.  He told me that I was going to take some of the money that I had saved and buy a hundred pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, I started to think of things I would say to him on Monday when he asked about the weights that I was not going to buy. Still, it made me feel special. My father never really got that close to caring. On Saturday I bought the weights, but I couldn’t even drag them to my mom’s car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.  Monday came and I was called into Mr. P.’s office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn’t looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time was I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn’t want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.  Weeks passed, and every once in a while Mr. P. would give me a shot and drop me in the hallway, sending my books flying. The other students didn’t know what to think. More weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.  Right before Christmas break I was walking to class, and from out of nowhere Mr. Pepperman appeared and gave me a shot in the chest. I laughed and kept going. He said I could look at myself now. I got home and ran to the bathroom and pulled off my shirt. I saw a body, not just the shell that housed my stomach and my heart. My biceps bulged. My chest had definition. I felt strong. It was the first time I can remember having a sense of myself. I had done something and no one could ever take it away.  You couldn’t say s–t to me.  It took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, that I was trying to lift that which does not want to be lifted. I was wrong. When the Iron doesn’t want to come off the mat, it’s the kindest thing it can do for you. If it flew up and went through the ceiling, it wouldn’t teach you anything. That’s the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble.  That which you work against will always work against you.  It wasn’t until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking, I know more about myself. When something gets bad, I know it can’t be as bad as that workout.  I used to fight the pain, but recently this became clear to me: pain is not my enemy; it is my call to greatness. But when dealing with the Iron, one must be careful to interpret the pain correctly. Most injuries involving the Iron come from ego. I once spent a few weeks lifting weight that my body wasn’t ready for and spent a few months not picking up anything heavier than a fork. Try to lift what you’re not prepared to and the Iron will teach you a little lesson in restraint and self-control.  I have never met a truly strong person who didn’t have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone’s shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, I see vanity exposing them in the worst way, as cartoon characters, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr. Pepperman.  Muscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.  Yukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion, a weakened body cannot sustain it for long. I have some of my most romantic thoughts when I am with the Iron. Once I was in love with a woman. I thought about her the most when the pain from a workout was racing through my body.  Everything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt, but she lived far away and I didn’t see her very often. Working out was a healthy way of dealing with the loneliness. To this day, when I work out I usually listen to ballads.  I prefer to work out alone.  It enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you’re made of is always time well spent, and I have found no better teacher. The Iron had taught me how to live. Life is capable of driving you out of your mind. The way it all comes down these days, it’s some kind of miracle if you’re not insane. People have become separated from their bodies. They are no longer whole.  I see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly, they lose sleep, they eat badly. And they behave badly. Their egos run wild; they become motivated by that which will eventually give them a massive stroke. They need the Iron Mind.  Through the years, I have combined meditation, action, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.  The Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it’s impossible to turn back.  The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you’re a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds."

Proposal 57,Supported By,0xa555d1ee16780b2d414ed97f4f169c0740099615,1.0,"Im voting FOR prop 57 because in the current world where nouns lacks a mechanism (or any type of process) to compensate for success of proposals (note we fund mostly costs) it makes rational sense for the proposer to include what they want upon success. Naturally its a contentious and painful topic to discuss. Before seeing what the project delivers, how are we to know what the success reward should be? People are mostly arguing that 1 noun is a lot, but it can also be much too little. Ultimately, the correct success reward is infinitely harder to decide upon before the fact and can lead to much wasted heartburn each time. This is why I’d advocate for us to put into place something like [Retroactive Impact Rewards - Nouns](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/retroactive-impact-rewards/884) to establish trust with proposers that we will reward success fairly and generously such that we can move the reward discussion moment to AFTER the project is delivered rather than before. In lack of such process and trust in the current state, I do not see it as bad faith or form that a proposer asks for what they want upon success as part of their funding proposal ask. I’ll leave the ambiguity of “successful delivery” which is the 1 noun delivery criteria outside of this discussion. I’m imaging there’s some judgement by the DAO to make when the time comes and should be additional incentive alignment for the proposer to actually deliver something clearly successful in order to earn the noun without debate.

Proposal 56,Supported By,0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87ff6034fc032d4722,1.0,"GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.  Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.  And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy."

Proposal 283,Opposed By,0x3cbd57da2f08b3268da07e5c9038c11861828637,1.0,"My thesis as a delegate is: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”  My analysis of funding requests is: 1. Is this a public good? 2. Is this public good something that other organizations won’t fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?  While the idea is fun and interesting, I don’t see a situation where it needs upfront funding from the DAO. Selling NFTs for pre-orders or pursuing other funding models and letting demand come bottom-up seems ideal. This has an excellent established path to funding that doesn’t require upfront payments from the DAO. I like the idea, but I don’t think that Nouns is uniquely best positioned to fund it.  It would be helpful to have more examples of which components are CC0. The proposal refers to it as a CC0 clothing brand, but it mentions using CC0 assets rather than making new CC0 assets. If the brand itself created CC0 elements in addition to leveraging CC0 elements, that would be very intriguing."

However there are a few issues that lean me towards voting against.  The first thing that caught my attention was that the designs werent very appealing and a bit uninspired to be honest.  Secondly, I dont see a clear path to success. I would have liked to see more information regarding marketing efforts and how this would help proliferate the meme in a meaningful way. Like many voters pointed out there isnt anything that stands out for the DAO to fund a clothing brand using cc0 assets. Giving a similar example, Nouns wipes have a strong marketing plan and a clear path to reach a different kind of audience. Thats more out of the box and in my eyes makes more sense for the DAO to finance."

Do not love the fact that the proposal includes patents and trademarks which will be given to the creator.   Anything that uses the Nouns treasury to build a product should include a plan to move said product into the CC0 space, as this is undoubtably the best way to proliferate the meme that is Nouns.  Id also like to take this opportunity to note that I see many proposals which include ballparkd timelines and budgets. This almost always ends in the proposal not passing, and I think anyone whos creating a prop would do well to break up their ask into a variety of smaller proposals with extreme clarity around how the funds are being allocated.  Hope to see a CC0 Nouns computer in the future. "

Proposal 276,Opposed By,0x3cbd57da2f08b3268da07e5c9038c11861828637,1.0,"My thesis as a delegate is: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”  My analysis of funding requests is: 1. Is this a public good? 2. Is this public good something that other organizations won’t fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?  This game, while potentially enjoyable art, is not a public good. It is not CC0 or freely licensed, and it cant be easily remixed by other Nouns supporters.  It is a business that may be successful and sustainable in its own right. That is excellent! There are many great venues for funding this, from venture capital to grants programs within the games industry to crowdfunding. The authors themselves point to crowdfunding as a potential option for fundraising for this game. But since there are many potential funding sources outside of Nouns, I dont believe that Nouns should find this.  As a result, I dont believe that this proposal is something that Nouns is uniquely suited to fund. I agree with Jihad that retroactive funding could be appropriate if this benefits Nouns, but I dont believe that Nouns should kickstart this. I would also reconsider this if the game were freely licensed and provided a building block for others to make Nounish games too. As it stands, other funding venues are likely more appropriate."

While I appreciate the effort and initiative behind this proposal, Im skeptical about its ability to make a significant impact.  However, beyond all of that the REAL deal-breaker for me is the proposed monetization strategies. In-app purchases and crowdfunding mechanics may work for some games, but I believe they miss the mark for the Nouns community. If the goal is to proliferate the Nouns meme, a DAO-funded game should be free to play, and the focus should be on creating an engaging, memorable experience that leaves players wanting to learn more about Nouns, not spending a few dollars on micro-transactions.  Its important to remember that successful games with an emphasis on multiplayer are built on communities and sustained by passionate players. If the proposed game fails to create an experience that resonates with the a wider audience, it has no real purpose. Ultimately, I think its important for the Nouns community to continue experimenting and exploring with projects of this nature, but we need to ensure that they align with the DAOs goals before gaining funding."

I trust the Nouns Esports crew and want to see them continue their work. I also feel like their compensation asks are reasonable, and that theyre negotiating fair deals with everyone involved.  My one request is for more high quality video content celebrating the players and Nouns. More highlight reels, more tournament winning celebrations, more player AMAs, more videos of people spamming noggles in the chat, more videos of players getting carried out with the crowd chanting their name. You are creating these iconic moments and I want to see them documented and celebrated.  ⌐[g]-[g]"
Proposal 263,Abstained By,0x2a019853a00ca3af202c262076da3308f606277f,1.0,"Imagine a world where voting does not exist. In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.  According to the “squad vote” result for proposal 263, which is 13 for, 14 against and 19 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):  Proposal 263 has presented us with a conundrum, making it difficult for us to render judgment. The Nouns Protector has just been established, and it may take approximately six months for clarifying our principles. We will briefly summarize the debates from our meeting:  Nouns Esports has accomplished laudable outcomes, genuinely creating a stable organization to underpin esports teams operations. This initial step is laden with myriad challenges that remain beyond our imagine. And, they have admirably maintained fiscal transparency throughout the process.  Despite their successes, the community has voiced concerns about the long-term viability of Nouns Esports as a business. Should Nouns Esports evolve into an entity that perpetually depletes NounsDAOs cash flow, depending on ceaseless transfusions from NounsDAO for sustenance, this model would not be sustainable for NounsDAO in the long run.  Furthermore, NounsDAO ought to concentrate on cultivating a more diverse and populous community. Some members posit that:   Nouns should channel resources into domains where it possesses an unambiguous competitive edge. Esports is not a realm where NounsDAO holds a competitive advantage. The Matthew effect is conspicuous within esports events, with elite teams monopolizing the lions share of attention and securing funding that far exceeds $800,000. This sector is fiercely competitive. Nouns Esports cannot amass a competitive cache of funds, which means they cannot engage top-tier players nor establish a premier support infrastructure. Consequently, they will only gain exposure in regional championships and open tournaments (as evidenced by their historical performance), unable to penetrate truly valuable core events. What merit is there in allocating excessive funds to a sphere where NounsDAO can only assume a secondary role, particularly for an organization in its nascent stages, with a community treasury of a mere $50 million?    More effective use of funds could be achieved by allocating 700 ETH to incubate 10 vibrant subculture DAOs across diverse fields, rather than expending a relatively negligible amount of funding to compete in conventional events.   Moreover, cautionary reminders have been raised about the pervasiveness of intimate personal relationships within NounsDAO:   Proposals prior to Proposal 200 have made considerable contributions to NounsDAOs present public image and clout. However, it has also engendered a nexus of relationships, with many decisions swayed by personal connections and predispositions. If NounsDAO is to pivot towards a more lucid, native, and truly growth trajectory—championing a broader array of NounishDAOs—the community networks forged during the preceding strategic round may serve as impediments. As a result, more resources may be funneled towards politically correct but inefficacious marketing proposals, suppressing the potential for vibrant but peripheral creators to enter the Nouns ecosystem.   Notwithstanding any criticisms, Nouns Esports remains an outstanding member of NounishDAO. Additionally, esports represents an excellent conduit for Nouns to interface with the external world. We extend our hopes and blessings for Nouns Esports to persist and excel."

The strategy and the demonstration of the strategy such that it is different than vanilla sponsorship relationships like what FTX or Avalanche have (that end when the sponsors stop paying) or such that Nouns.gg is a sustainable organization that participates in the growth and performance of its teams in a differentiated way that is workable for a DAO. If theres co-sponsorship opportunities or low hanging fruit, I want to see those realized before committing $800k/yr. Its been almost 9 months and the challenge is to manifest a strategy that clearly supports this spend.  Its a real challenge and the DAO has to consider that there may not be a way to do this that returns to the DAO -- this does not seem to as of yet for example.  The people in the Nouns esports pod are running it well and are highly functional. They are people I respect and trust uniformly. The issue I have is strategy and spend."

He has expertise in this industry and had some useful   feedback and concerns  Im voting Yes after taking it all in.  My rationale: -This is a differentiated experimental model for branded Nounish goods.  If it proves successful, its replicable. (Nouns Whisky minted at 500   barrels per year, entirely different products, etc) -102 ETH is 2-3 days of auctions today at a local nadir, < 1% of our annual runrate. The cost isnt particularly high. -This will return ETH no matter what, so the ETH cost is less than 102 stated. -Andre is real and its a thoughtful plan even given concerns that can be raised.  Will be on them to deliver and execute in Year 3, not just Year   0. -I will absolutely buy this product and probably know a bunch of people who would, so theres PMF. -The NFT angle with the branded product is a good one, has life and adds legs.  Owning a barrel over time is an experiential good, and something   you can do with a group of friends. -Plays with commitments and ventures over longer time frames than most DAOs do or would.  We are oriented to the long term uniquely.  We expect to   be around in 2026 and in 2036 and in 2069."

I am not sure that this project really needs Nouns to succeed. There is probably demand for whisky-barrel backed NFTs, generally. (Though I do think there is probably some legal concern here.) I am not sure that Nouns makes this product more exciting or likely to succeed, apart from us giving the upfront capital. But I think you could likely sell NFTs to get that capital, anyway, if theres interest. It feels a bit like a white-label product with Nouns put on. I am also not sure whether alcohol is something Nounish.   Thanks again for your time and wish you success with this! "

However, using NFTs for tokenized ownership is a good proof of principle that will help bring NFTs to the normies.   I would also prefer a long term strategy rather than a white-label approach, but this is still a net win imo."

Bringing Nouns to places where culture and ideas are loved and celebrated like Coachella, SXSW, Burning Man, etc adds to the Nouns lore in a positive way especially when the energy that they bring to their events is proven. We have a massive treasury and I think this is a fair price to pay to continue the support of one of the most dedicated builders in Nouns.  Excited to hopefully see another year of the Aubtoshi and NounsOTG show!"
Proposal 206,Supported By,0x008c84421da5527f462886cec43d2717b686a7e4,28.0,I would lean towards 0xHindsights feedback and Bs around funding something wherein the value is hard to demonstrate after time and money has been spent on similar activities.  And that theres more scalable value on the design of marketing/activations kit/formula that can be run by local teams without a dependency on one person or team.  But I am voting Yes because Aubtoshi has been singular and I would like to see it continue.  And the use of de facto milestones via the multisig is good to see and they stated clearly they will return any ETH more than the USDC they need. This works out to two weeks of auctions to fund Nouns On the Ground on the ground in a year where positive energy and in-person activations and marketing from other NFT projects will be less. More valuable now than in a raging bull for sure.  Ball will be in their court to demonstrate this was ETH well spent and that we should spend ETH again in the future.

But Value Generated must be > Price Paid and scaling  UP an effort to this size that cant clearly demonstrate the value created from the previous funding rounds doesnt make much sense. The follow up prop should be either the same size or smaller until a model is found that clearly works.   On the ground activation efforts are difficult and this prop mentions using podcasts, video footage etc - but the Nouns on the Ground Twitter page has about 800 followers, the YouTube has 65 subscribers and the listenership to spaces is low too. I would like to see some targets for these things in the prop - as distribution matters if content is being created. (Maybe a landing page for NOTG or POAPs would be good too to measure attribution at some level)  I would like to see a revised proposal at a more reasonable level and would also support additional (good) proposals or prop house rounds that leverage the decentralised community we have to give local teams an opportunity to activate more Nouners IRL.   Generally speaking: A vote against a proposal is not a vote against a proposer. Voting no now is not voting no forever on everything. Its healthy to vote down proposals in order to give and integrate feedback. "

We’ve seen this particular builder, Aubtoshi go through the whole process of failed prop houses, then small grants funding, and slowly scaling up to this. The structure of this next year laid out in this depth excites me that anyone is this passionate enough to actually DO THE WORK. We’ve seen some amazing things happen that weren’t even planned due to this style of activation, such as nouns in a shopify web3 ad! Being able to plan a year in advance like this also allows many others to potentially also embolden these activities by adding to the experiences. Planning ahead is everything for this type of initiative and it makes sense to see nouns at all of these events."

Proposal 206,Supported By,0xba2b9804fbffa8f1a8f7dc8dd600e21268bef09f,1.0,"- For nouns dao props, the intangibles (authenticity & culture) have considerably more weight than in your usual org. - Aub deeply understand the culture, is v nounish and is genuine in her work. - Second order effects of having some like that ^ vs a more systematized, “sophisticated” and more efficient team at w/e event add more weight to the FOR side. - Lastly, costs and strategy: while i agree that these 2 vectors could be improved, I think of the premium being paid as the cost of (hopefully) attracting/signaling more folks to compete for the pot. Fwiw: we’ve seen this happen already with other “roles” within the dao.  So i’m voting FOR while encouraging her to be more nounish about her approach (events selected, activations, etc)."
Proposal 206,Supported By,0xbc3ed6b537f2980e66f396fe14210a56ba3f72c4,2.0,"I have learned a lot from all the discussion around this proposal. Thanks all! I am voting for it because - I think that Nouns *should* have something going on for all these event. There are many alternative ways approaches that have been brought up, but I tend to think most will not actually happen or will not happen in time. If other people have other things they want to do, we should fund those too!  - The plan laid out really is pretty ambitious (144 podcasts!). I think the ask is reasonable for the work. Everyone I have talked to who has met Aubotshi speaks very highly of her. It seems she gets Nouns, is a great ambassador, and is worth taking the risk on.  - When it comes to spreading the meme, I think time is value. Better to spend sooner on a proposal you’re 80% happy with than try to wait for something you’re 100% happy with.  Thanks Aubotshi! Excited to see all that comes out of this! "

I strongly believe in OTG proliferation and content creation so I am a little conflicted.*   **BENJAMIN LATSKO ⌐◧-◧** | *not scalable. recommended an alternative prop: craft an IRL activation playbook*  **JoshuaFisher** | *couldnt imagine not giving this team the tools request to keep going*  **Josep** | *I think an iteration of the proposal should be made, the proposal could be divided by quarters.*  **Benbodhi** | *nounish af ⌐◨-◨*  **nonodynamo** | *I think that it is important to have an in-person presence at events. The impact is not just in the secondary media after the fact it is at the event itself.  Nouns On The Ground give a connection to the community as a whole.*   **Blu ⌐◨-◨** | *Nouns OTG is about building friendships & connecting us all 💙 we need that.*  **Mach** | *cost is too high with little deliverables, no quantification of impact, majority non impact events. No concrete goals to propel nouns forward.*  **pin.pusher** | *Aubtoshi is the best but don’t tell her - Toady Hawk from OTG Discord*  **profwerder** | *There is an extensive amount of organization for events and event travel. We do need a go to person who can not only carry out events but as a contact for other IRL opportunities that might present itself. Decentralization is a feature and a bug. Sometimes we need those ambassadors who can help bring others in while proliferating and Aubtoshi does this extremely well. This should not prohibit other approaches but this type of outreach is vital at this early stage of the DAO.*  **kerimbonia** | *Yes Yes Yes... a nouns presence at all of the events proposed with a nouns community member that has showed nothing but passion for proliferating nouns is a no-brainer yes from me. the budget is definitely in line with the ambitious roadmap as well... gl aubtoshi!*  **RobotFishGirl** | *the best written and most valuable prop in awhile*  **andreitr** | *I was initially skeptical about including so many events into a single proposal but after talking to Aubtoshi and seeing how much time and effort went into planning this I changed my mind. Voting yes because NounsOTG has a proven track record and having a year-long events plan makes sense.*  **Coral Orca** | *aubtoshi is nounish*  **systemdm.⌐◨-◨** | *Absolut yes from me. I think the work @aubtoshi  - Nouns on the Ground has been doing is amazing.  Strongly believe in the power of IRL events to proliferate beyond the NFT bubble..which is  what its all about IMO.. 👍🏻*  **Mindtoasted** | *Absolute yes from me, I like the things that Nouns On The Ground is doing irl, Its very Nounish and proven concrete.*  **RyanMac ⌐◨-◨** | *ETH price at time of prop posting was $1,330 with the 10% buffer @570 ETH this would be $758,100 (not the listed $623,986). Now, with ETH on the rise, the USDC cost of this prop is $885,100.*  *That’s a 42% difference ($261,114) from the USDC price that is listed in the proposal $623,986*  *The proposer should resubmit with a USDC ask since the DAO added a system to pay in USDC for these volatile market situations. Also, who are the other 2-3 members of the NOTG team? The lack of information about the other 2-3 team members & there duties is alarming.*  ---  For more Nouns DAO proposal discussion head to the Nouncil Discord: https://discord.gg/nouncil"
