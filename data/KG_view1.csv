Proposal 134,Summary,Liberating Proposal Threshold for 26 years  Change the threshold to put a proposal on-chain from the current 2 votes to 1 vote.  Why: - We are disenfranchising roughly 80% of noun holders currently. - We are not seeing many proposals coming in. - We want to empower any nouner or delegate to participate in the DAO.  Setting the proposal threshold to 1 would require 2 votes again once we passed 9999 nouns in roughly 26 years.

This update is necessary because the admin of a transparent proxy is unable to call functions on the implementation contract. In this case, the implementation contract is the [NounsAuctionHouse]( which includes administrative functions such as `setTimeBuffer`, `setReservePrice`, and `setMinBidIncrementPercentage`.  The `NounsAuctionHouseProxyAdmin` is owned by the `NounsDAOExecutor` and is used as a dedicated interface to facilitate auction house proxy upgrades while maintaining the ability to call functions that exist on `NounsAuctionHouse`."
