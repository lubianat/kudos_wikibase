Proposal 1,Summary,"Donate 5 ETH each to 6 Charities

*Past Discussions*
- [Original proposal with emoji consensus](
- [SharkDAO adds Coral Restoration Foundation](
- [4156 adds GiveCrypto](

As the first test of Nouns DAO governance and to demonstrate to the community how the ecosystem works, we will donate 5 ETH each to 6 charities. With the exception of Coral Restoration Foundation and GiveCrypto, these charities were chosen because they have publicly available Ethereum donation addresses.
Coral Restoration Foundation was recommended by SharkDAO and their representative Goldy.mov generated an address on the charity's site. GiveCrypto was recommended by 4156 and he generated an address on the charity's site.

Change the threshold to put a proposal on-chain from the current 2 votes to 1 vote.

Why:
- We are disenfranchising roughly 80% of noun holders currently.
- We are not seeing many proposals coming in.
- We want to empower any nouner or delegate to participate in the DAO.

Setting the proposal threshold to 1 would require 2 votes again once we passed 9999 nouns in roughly 26 years."

It is also left up to the discretion of the Prop House team to decide how to best conduct this experiment, as long as the specifications above are met.

Proposal 151,Summary,"Refill Nouns Strategic Funding Works (NSFW) Pool

 Refill Nouns Strategic Funding Works (NSFW) Pool

Nouns Strategic Funding Works (NSFW), formerly Small Grants, is running low on ETH and needs to be refilled. 

NSFW is a pool of capital that serves the DAO's interest, stewarded on a completely discretionary basis by the group's members, and funds things that include:
* Small Grants
* Retro Rewards
* Residencies
* Trials ahead of sponsoring on-chain proposals
* Ad hoc DAO needs - contests, bug bounties, being the DAO’s “hot wallet”

The group conducts its daily operations in the Discord in the -and-retro-funding-channel, as well as on the Nouns [Discourse forum](

**[This link contains information on everything NSFW has ever funded.](

Previous NSFW Proposals:
* [Prop 13 - 20 ETH Inception](
* [Prop 31 - 50 ETH Refill](
* [Prop 43 - 100 ETH Refill](
* [Prop 85 - 200 ETH Refill](
* [Prop 111 - Noun 22 Contract Extension](
    * 111 contains more detailed context on NSFW's role in the DAO and its day to day operations.  This proposal also funded NSFW with 50 ETH."

Locations can be selected from a map/list of options. We can also have a discussion of whether we just want nouns glasses or also want to showcase some specific nouns (perhaps via some sort of auction that goes back to the nouns treasury).
Prices are subject to change depending on city and install date and changes in ETH. So we may get slightly fewer or more depending on where the price settles when the ETH investment is approved and converted to USD to pay the vendors."

 Summary

This proposal updates the Nouns DAO logic contract to a new version, with a single minor improvement:

**Vote with Gas Refund**: change refund destination such that multisig voter that pays for gas get refunded, rather than sending the refund to the multisig contract. 

Technically, this change involves refunding `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender`.

Exact changes can be seen here: 

Because this change is very minor, we're not going through an official audit process. This change has been reviewed thoroughly by technical DAO members (solimander & vapeape).

Hi hello,

This is a simple proposal to set the reverse record from the treasury to be nouns.eth. By setting this reverse record, anyone will be able to easily send anything to Nouns by simply inputting nouns.eth.

There are over [50 Nounish DAOs]( that are donating a nounders reward to Nouns, and with [Prop 190]( we are now minting onchain. Unless you happen to know the Nouns address by memory it's not obvious.

![](
[*Mint*](

As Nouns continues to do things onchain (like setting up its ENS), it will be increasingly important that the community can easily recognize if something is coming from Nouns or not—setting the reverse record does just that.

I've also added a 1 ETH payment to myself for the idea."

Proposal 233,Summary,"Nouns Acquisition Committee - delegation changes

The Nouns Acquisition Committee (NAC) was established by Proposal 44, and has successfully acquired Nouns on behalf of the DAO for later distribution to builders as compensation.

The NAC Multisig (0x9298B97dE93784635900163e582A5D9e570f35a5) currently custodies 3 nouns in escrow on behalf of builders with approved but incomplete proposals. They are delegated to the Nouncil as specified in the original proposal.

These Nouns are collectively owned by the DAO. As Nouncil has grown and developed its own culture that is distinct from the greater NounsDAO, this delegation is no longer appropriate. 

This proposal instructs the NAC to:
1) delegate these Nouns to itself (0x9298B97dE93784635900163e582A5D9e570f35a5)
2) refrain from voting on future proposals."

Proposal 25,Summary,"Fix Auction House Proxy Admin Misconfiguration

This proposal corrects a protocol misconfiguration by updating the auction house proxy admin from the [NounsDAOExecutor]( contract to the [NounsAuctionHouseProxyAdmin]( contract.

This update is necessary because the admin of a transparent proxy is unable to call functions on the implementation contract. In this case, the implementation contract is the [NounsAuctionHouse]( which includes administrative functions such as `setTimeBuffer`, `setReservePrice`, and `setMinBidIncrementPercentage`.

The `NounsAuctionHouseProxyAdmin` is owned by the `NounsDAOExecutor` and is used as a dedicated interface to facilitate auction house proxy upgrades while maintaining the ability to call functions that exist on `NounsAuctionHouse`."

Proposal 261,Summary,"Dynamic Quorum Updates

**TL;DR - increase max quorum from 15% to 20%**

**Dynamic Quorum Parameter Updates**
As articulated in this [detailed post]( three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum.

 CURRENT SETTINGS
1. **Minimum quorum %:** currently set to 10%
2. **Maximum quorum %:** currently set to 15%
3. **Coefficient:** currently set to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.

 PROPOSED SETTINGS
1. **Minimum quorum %:** 10% (no change)
2. **Maximum quorum %:** set to 20% 
3. **Coefficient:** 1 (no change)

 RATIONALE
1. Dynamic quorum was designed so that contentious proposals would require a higher degree of support. 
2. Maximum quorum is currently too low to have changed the outcome of any recent proposals.
3. Increasing maximum quorum should increase the percentage of successful proposals that are ""hell yes"" initiatives.

 PROPOSAL TRANSACTIONS
`_setDynamicQuorumParams`: sets dynamic quorum params to:
1. Minimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points) (no change).
1. Maximum quorum BPs: 20% (2000 basis points).
1. Coefficient: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with 6 decimal places) (no change)."

 Description
This proposal increases the proposal threshold from 25 -> 30bps. Success of this proposal means 3 Nouns are required to submit a proposal to the DAO until Noun 1000. This is approximately ~263 days^.

By increasing the proposal threshold, we should expect an overall reduction in the number of proposals submitted. While this may lead to a lower number of submitted proposals, widespread use of delegation will allow the highest quality proposals to be submitted, and sufficiently mitigate these concerns. An additional benefit is a lower risk of voter fatigue.

^ At the time of this proposal it is currently Noun 707. The proposal threshold would be >3 at Noun 1000. There are 293 Nouns until then. At a minting rate of 1.1 a day (accounting the for the Nounder reward), this results in approximately 263 days."

As an alternative to Proposal 81, we submit to sell Noun  to Lil Nouns DAO for a fair market* price of 69.420 ETH.

We don't believe that it is a wise decision to gift Lil Nouns a noun, but we do want to see Lil Nouns succeed, and would like to see them join the DAO. And therefore we propose to facilitate their purchase of one for 69.420 ETH in a historic DAO to DAO on chain transaction.

This is a proposal to create an on-chain offer only fillable by Lil Nouns treasury.

Lil Nouns will have to successfully pass a governance proposal of their own to accept this offer.

This proposal was developed by:
* 142
* Goldy
* Noun 172 | niftynaut
* beautyandpunk | B | Noun 137

_Developed & posted on chain spontaneously during a very productive Nouner World Call_

_* ""fair market"" was calculated as the lowest noun sale in the past 7 days on auction (67 eth) + 2."

Proposal by Noun 22

The Retroactive Funding and Small Grants Pool is running low on ETH and needs to be refilled. Since [inception]( the group has funded a number of project trials, Nouns derivatives, tattoos, ⌐-s, and other contributions to the Nouns ecosystem.  The full list of everything the group has paid out is available [here]( with further context on recent activity in these tweets ([1]( [2](

As the DAO scales, Small Grants role has evolved.  This flexible pool of capital is here to serve the DAO's interest on a fully discretionary basis.

This group was formed with an initial pool of 20 ETH and was [topped up with 50 ETH]( in January 2022, and then again [with 100 ETH]( in March 2022. This proposal would top up the group's multisig with another 200 ETH."
