**Coordinape**
https://app.coordinape.com/circles/3373/history

This project was intended as an experiment, providing a collective decision on how to retroactively allocate ETH to Nounish contributors for their work in Nouns. We asked the question and left the answer to the community. Would people allocate it all to the top achievers? Spread it evenly through the community? Would bad actors try to scheme ways to play the system?

We chose a commonly used DAO tool (Coordinape) and hoped to see where it shines, where it falls short, observing the emergent behaviour. We could then take that knowledge and produce some recommendations for the future. I have attached the final ETH values below, and will be doing my own analysis of lessons learned on this one. I will post them here, and publicly, as a final wrap-up of this project. Everyone else is welcome to post your own lessons and analyses.

On a very simple level this is a list of Nounish contributors who are **here**, present, spending their attention on Nouns, building in public, creating our culture, collectively steering the Nounish ship. You are the building blocks of of the Nouniverse. It's not an exhaustive list, we are missing several influential contributors, but it's a good list. It's a community.

Thank you all for being here. This last year with Nouns has been a blessing and I'm excited for many more years of this. üôè",

Through DMs, voice calls, and Carrier Pigeons, we have officially collected all of the Nounish work descriptions we can, manually confirmed wallet addresses, and have a nominee table for Prop 63. There are 105 Nounish builders with a variety of contributions from ""I stir the pot"" to prop builders and sub DAO founders covering the entire Nouniverse. We have 100 ETH to split between them.

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR COORDINAPE NOMINEES**
If you were nominated you can now take part in our gigantic coordinape. You have 10 days to do the following:

 - Read through the contribution descriptions from the 105 nominees
 - Open the Coordinape cicle: https://app.coordinape.com/circles/3373/history
 - Allocate your 1000 GIVE tokens as you see fit
 - at the end of the EPOCH you can see how many tokens you were allocated
 - GET PAID

**WHAT BUT HOW DO I DECIDE WHO TO ALLOCATE TO**
Choose your own adventure. You could:

 - equally split tokens between all nominees
 - go through the nominee list and assign each one a token amount that seems appropriate
 - divide nominees into categories (minor, major, MVP) and allocate more tokens to people in higher categories
 - give all your tokens to a small group you thought had the most impact on Nouns
 - give all your tokens to a single person you thought had the most impact in Nouns
 - don't allocate your tokens at all and watch your Grinch-Heart shrivel up

People will be able to see how much tokens you allocated them and you can't allocate to yourself. Feel free to discuss allocation strategies here. How do we reward Nounish builders? How do we bring the best talent in, how do we build a strong community. It's an experiment!

* are we thinking the target entity that we nominate / vote for are only individuals or also proposals? (noting that proposals are often teams / groups) 
> I think it's a trade off. we might not have enough ETH for this to be meaningful rewards towards past proposals. but limiting it to non-proposals might skew the conversation towards people and not projects. that might be what we want but worth thinking about. 

* are we thinking that the people that vote are nominees only OR are we thinking non-nominees (e.g. general nouners) also vote?
> my gut is to leverage non-nominees too but maybe it's hard to get enough participation? also if it's weighted by number of nouns owned, then we might end up with nounders + a few whales by and large deciding the outcome. 

* is self-nomination allowed?
> I think we should and no reason to shame/limit against imo.

* are nominees allowed / encouraged to campaign? is there going to be some forum for them to write out their work & impact from their own view? 
> I think it might be important to set the right tone. I personally would like a culture where ppl are encouraged to shamelessly advocate for themselves. at least all performance conversations I'm used to start from the individual giving an overview / advocating for the impact of their work. also if this isn't encouraged then only the more visible & top of mind people / projects might get voted for since there is no new information to consider holistically. 

* are voters (beyond the person nominating) going to be able to share supporting comments (reasons) associated with their vote?
> I think this would be a key way in which people that worked closely to an individual or a project can offer their view on the details and impact of the work. I think this and the question above can help reduce the likelihood of the ""Nightmare Scenario"" outlined in the doc where ppl feel hurt due to ""feeling underrecognized by peers"".

* what is the time period of the impact we're evaluating?
> easy / fair approach could be all past contribution since inception. but then again maybe we don't have enough ETH for since inception. or maybe we do. idk. 

* how do we gauge success? 
> the strongest signal for me would be if the rewardees' long-term contribution trajectory towards the DAO moves up materially. the number of people that had gone somewhat inactive but turned active again. the number of on-chain proposals or prop house proposals submitted by rewardees. maybe even a survey of the rewardees asking them if the rewards have had any boost in their good will, feeling of being fairly compensated / respected, desire to take on a more ambitious project has increased after the program. 

* do we have any intention or time interval in which we'd do this again? 
> of course we can just not address this question since this can be considered a one-off pilot. but there's a psychological difference in how the rewardee might experience the reward if they know that this is a pilot of a continuous (let's say quarterly) retroactive impact reward program. there's an element here in which we can't test whether human behavior will change based on retroactive rewards unless there is some expectation that the retroactive reward would continue in the future. if not, then regardless of the amount of reward you just received, the most economically rational thing might be to not change your behavior since it was it was retroactive and one-off (no action owed, and has no impact on future reward).","The question asked was about various aspects of the nomination and voting process for the Nouns DAO impact rewards.

Let me give you a hint here on proposal 1183 which we have put for vote in the Nouns Mandates round 2 on governance.

https://prop.house/proposal/1183

Titel: Nouns Review House
rl;dr: Streamline the Prop House proposal & evaluation process +++ self-financing +++ on-chain +++ forever

The solution is to simplify and decrease the work to done for the nouns wrt the evaluation and voting of thousands of Prop.House proposals. 
From the conceptional work our final goal is to build a Nouns Review House DAO which streamlines the proposal and evaluation process. Reviewers will for example be rewarded or punished depending on the final voting results. Also the Nouns Review House will be self-financed by e.g. a percentage of the grant.

I see some synergies with other proposals in this round. So perhaps the nouns will vote for meaningful package.

What do you think?
Is the solution we are thinking about addressing a real problem.

Cheers from Munich!

P.S. some lower-priority questions we wanted to listen to your thoughts on:
* isDataURIEnabled: noticed it was removed in your branch, but we thought it could be nice to keep
* NFTDescriptor: could it make sense to convert it into a contract? we find it generally more convenient to work with contracts, and not sure of the reasons it's a library atm
* Inflate: it's currently a private library; curious for your thoughts on whether it should become a public library or a contract?
* `ISVGRenderer.Part.palette` is a pointer to an SSTORE contract: we were thinking to experiment with it being `bytes` similar to the `image` part, but thought maybe you explored that and had reasons to keep it as a pointer, like gas savings? the benefit of such a change is mostly a design consideration, i.e. making SVGRenderer unaware of storage sources, thus not imposing such a constraint on its users","The question was about feedback on the proposed implementation and some lower-priority questions. The direct replies from solimander#7468 provide feedback on the implementation and address the lower-priority questions. Here's a summary of the answers:

1. Regarding trait retirement, it's better to leave it out of the implementation until there's consensus on how traits should be selected for retirement.
2. isDataURIEnabled can be added back in for the sake of forkers.
3. NFTDescriptor can be converted into a contract if preferred, as there's no strong reason for it to be a library.
4. For Inflate, it's worth looking into gas implications before deciding whether to make it a public library or a contract.
5. Changing ISVGRenderer.Part.palette from a pointer to bytes could be a reasonable solution, and it's worth looking into.

Additionally, there are some discussions about issues with the frontend and subgraph, but they are not directly related to the original question."

If a builder needs more funds sooner than the DAO can swap, the mev/arb bots will work to swap the rest. The community seems to agree that this solution is a good fit for Nouns DAO, as it improves the builder UX and allows for trustless swapping of ETH for stablecoins."

Is this if you vote opposite of what happens? Was looking for clarity on why the DAO would reimburse gas here but couldn‚Äôt find it.

There is a 17% savings in compression when using multi RLE + batch deflate compared to multi RLE + deflate, but it's not clear if the added complexity is worth it. There is also a discussion about gas savings from writing fewer pointers and the possibility of optimizing without batch compression.

It was suggested to try using a transaction approach instead, pointing at a local Anvil node for better performance, and using the gas-optimized version of inflate.sol. The updated gas was 111,930,036, which is in the expected range. However, the issue with the vertical RLE still needs further investigation."

proposal 114 (https://nouns.wtf/vote/114) proposes to change the appearance of some nouns - most of the changes are unnoticeable (like bug fixes), but some are actually noticeable, in particular the colors of some glasses.

why is this a problem?
reason 1 (reliable appearance): nouners may be planning some branding, generating some memes, paying designers, making stickers, etc - it's annoying to have to account for the re-design some of these features
reason 2 (kind of precedent): same as above, but now nouners know that their noun can change (and change is unclear here, will we change colors? content? taco ingredients?), and when there is change people are less like to build on top of things that aren't reliable

potential ways forward
1) philosophy 1: accept anything can change
2) philosophy 2: accept anything can change, but only from now onwards (legacy nouns will still look the same)
3) philosophy 3: vote against proposals that change nouns, since it make it difficult for others to realy on these appearances and we don;t want to set a bad precedent

I removed this as it was only put in place because we were unsure if OS would support dataURIs in time for the initial Nouns launch. Thinking keep it as a fallback in case dataURIs stop working or the Nouns on-chain data otherwise breaks?

> * NFTDescriptor: could it make sense to convert it into a contract? we find it generally more convenient to work with contracts, and not sure of the reasons it's a library atm

Thought other contracts may want to re-use and didn't really need any of the features of a full contract. Don't feel too strongly either way

In practice the suggested solution can be such that most all props are paid directly in USD, as a function of how large the DAO decides the ‚ÄúUSD buffer‚Äù should be (aka the DAO‚Äôs USD position).

In addition, even if builders find themselves receiving IOU tokens, their challenge is quite minimal since what they have received is USD-pegged and gets redeemed by clicking on the ‚Äúredeem‚Äù button.

Btw your feedback did get us thinking: perhaps we should let anyone call redeem for anyone else with IOU balance; this way anyone in the community can help them out by converting their IOUs into stablecoins.

re: having a ‚Äúswap pod‚Äù, I think the DAO benefits from having these swaps execute trustlessly; it should lead to more predictable outcomes, without this task having to fight for anyone‚Äôs attention (Nouner attention seems like a scarce resource we should not use lightly). In addition, a trustless solution lends itself more as a public good for other DAOs to use, and that seems Nounish.

I suspect a point where we might disagree most is on the cost of builders not getting paid immediately. 

- I am confident we can configure this contract to serve us well, even if it means increasing the premium bots get to trade with us
- Even if there will be a delay, we‚Äôll likely still pay partially thanks to the USD buffer, and I believe in most cases a short delay won‚Äôt pose a material problem for builders",

The conversation suggests that the change mostly protects from a scenario in which someone has temporary control of the vetoer account and uses it to change the vetoer to their own account.

I think there‚Äôs a strategic decision to be made by NounsDAO with regard to treasury management:

A. ETH-only 
B. staked ETH - a low-risk, conservative and passive strategy
C. DeFi yield generation - actively managed yield generation 

I would argue in favour of A or B given the early stage NounsDAO is at. This could be a decision that we take for the next 365 days and revisit it annually. 

Let me explain the reasoning. As much as I love yield generation, and hate to see the treasury ETH ‚Äújust sitting there‚Äù I think we should be mindful about where we direct our attention and efforts. 

What we should consciously avoid at this stage is ‚Äúincrementalism‚Äù in our thinking and this is exactly where strategy C will lead us. Should we get 5% more here or there? Is that farm 20% safer or riskier? Every new person joining will have their own theory about yield generation. None of them will materially move the needle. 

By deciding that for the next 365 days we decide *NOT* to have any yield generation discussions (outside of staking ETH) we focus ourselves on core 10x innovations NounsDAO is uniquely positioned to introduce. Yield management is not one of them. 

Just a quick pulse check on what other think of it. Which strategy should we focus on for the next 365 days?","Based on the conversation, the question about which treasury management strategy NounsDAO should focus on for the next 365 days was not directly answered. However, there were opinions shared in favor of staking ETH (option B) and some discussions about other potential investments like BTC, NFTs, and ERC-20 tokens. It is suggested that a small and elite committee could be formed to make recommendations on financial strategies for the organization."

Most noun owners know how to grow wealth, that is how they got to afford a noun. Most noun owners could certainly be (and probably are) putting their personal treasuries to work via yield earning. 

What is the appeal of nounsdao? What is the UVP of being a member and investing capital here as opposed to elsewhere?

I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs that you can pool your ETH together to participate in the same yield generation activities that you already can on your own‚Ä¶ The opportunity here is the model created where the feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns, driving value to the NFTs, bootstrapping community and all the good stuff that spending the ETH in novel and experimental ways can bring.

Is attention/focus/time the scarcest commodity in crypto? And are some of nouns greatest assets the brains, experience, and connections of the nouners themselves? 

My fear is that every minute nouners spend thinking and debating traditional treasury management measures like yield generation is time not spent engaging in the unique opportunity this project presents us, and therefore kind of‚Ä¶ a waste. Could be done elsewhere, way more efficiently, where attention is not so split and votes aren‚Äôt required and it doesn‚Äôt have to be balanced out with the greater vision which is facing a different direction.","The appeal of NounsDAO is the unique opportunity it presents for its members to pool their resources and invest in novel and experimental ways that drive value to the NFTs, bootstrap community, and create a feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns. The focus should be on the cultural capital and clout of the organization, rather than traditional treasury management measures like yield generation. The project aims to create one of the most sought-after memberships, status symbols, and cultural artifacts in the world by using the treasury to increase demand."

decisions we expect will require more deliberation:

1. which token do we want to pay in? e.g. USDC vs DAI 
2. the amount of the baseline position the DAO will hold, denominated in USD (the baseline amount helps pay builders immediately, vs asking builders to wait until we can buy USD on chain)
2.1 with this decision the DAO can set lower and upper bounds within which an admin multisig can adjust things without going through the proposal process

---

decisions we expect should be easier to decide on:

1. the max price slippage rate; this should be easy as the DAO can set a reasonable upper bound and let the admin multisig find an optimal value gradually on mainnet
2. who should be the admin; personally I think the tech pod multisig is a great choice with highly relevant people already part of that team (to clarify: the highest owner role is of course the DAO's; the admin has more limited configuration rights)

I've written screenplays for both theatre and tv and they're incredibly different from novels, comics and other types of literary work (imho); any type of creation drives influence from the writer's world and I find this to be very tricky once it comes down to Nouns, hence each Noun is used as a form of presentation ~ would an owner feel comfortable having their Noun used as an antagonist that does 'bad' things?
Would a noun owner feel comfortable having their noun stand for something (in the piece) that they don't personally stand for?

The way to fix the issue above is to have characters driven/influenced by Noun aesthetics rather than use the actual characters (this is my pov, I assume others have very different ideas on how to tackle this) ~ this way, we still have infinite amount of worlds that could co-exist that are driven out of Nouns and their visuals which is far better than having one fixed story.

- What does ‚ÄúLast seen today‚Äù mean?
- What‚Äôs the hover color for the buttons, similar blue or reddish? 

**‚Ä®Loved**
- Nav buttons are great, I love the blue for Connect
- ‚ÄúNoun {auctionNum}‚Äù to Londrina font is perfect
- I like the cool background
- LOVE the next-minimum-bid being the input-placeholder, perfect
    - Would still watch that font size. In mobile input, it seems like a placeholder of a ‚Äúwider‚Äù 3-digit bid like 2xx.69 (vs 1xx.69) may be crowded

**Notes**
- Not crazy about Treasury component being by Home logo. Not used to seeing anything near a top-left logo.
    - It‚Äôs better on mobile, maybe truly centered though?
- Winning Bid numbers being that big make me wonder about triple digits bids & spacing. I guess, you won‚Äôt have the thousandths place decimal so it‚Äôll even out. Maybe still slightly big font? Since it‚Äôs the same for winning address try substituting for ‚Äúbeautifulpunks.eth‚Äù or ‚Äúdavidzhorvath.eth‚Äù or even ‚Äúmarvelvscapcom.eth‚Äù to make sure it‚Äôll fit. Those are some of the longer bidders we see.
- Lastly, on mobile, I feel like ‚ÄúNoun {auctionNum}‚Äù should be the first thing directly under the Noun, I know it‚Äôs a lot to fit in there. Maybe try just flipping arrows/date with ‚ÄúNoun {auctionNum}‚Äù just to see

Yes! I have some comparable data on how much other esports teams are sponsored for and what they receive in return. Let's start with Dota as an example. Our team is currently ranked 3rd out of the 16 teams that compete in the Pro Circuit in North America, and we are proposing to pay our players up to $4000 per month.

In comparison, the two teams ranked above us in Dota are Shopify Rebellion and TSM. Shopify Rebellion players, historically one of the most dominant NA teams, are making around $20,000 per month. TSM brought in a new squad consisting of international players from regions across the world and receive between $5000 to $7000 per month.

In South America, the top two teams that we've competed against historically receive $9000 and $12,000 per month, respectively.

In the CS:GO vertical, our players are also receiving up to $4000 per month. The most dominant teams in North America are Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses. Team Liquid is one of the best teams internationally and has a long history in esports. While every player on their team likely makes six figures of salary, star players on independent contracts likely earn upwards of $20-30k per month. Generally speaking all the top teams are making six-figures of salary.

Evil Geniuses is running a unique program in CS:GO with a ""main"" roster and two training squads, ""White"" and ""Black."" Their training rosters earn $5000 per month, while their main roster likely earns double that.

In both game verticals we believe we've identified and are working with teams that fit in a sweet spot of skill, player notoriety, and cost.

So what do these esports orgs get in return?  Attention. They are brands that sell content and association with their content. In Shopify Rebellion's case, they have no additional sponsors, but in the case of teams like Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses, esports native brands, they have a sleeve full of sponsors who pay to be a part of the team's journey.","Other esports teams are sponsored for varying amounts depending on their ranking and performance. For example, in Dota, Shopify Rebellion players make around $20,000 per month, while TSM players receive between $5,000 to $7,000 per month. In the CS:GO vertical, top teams like Team Liquid have players making six-figure salaries, with star players earning upwards of $20-30k per month. Evil Geniuses' main roster likely earns double the $5,000 per month that their training rosters receive.

In return for sponsorship, esports organizations gain attention and brand recognition. They sell content and association with their content, attracting both endemic and non-endemic sponsors who pay to be part of the team's journey."

I appreciate your perspective on the conversion impact of this proposal. While it's true that two people buying nouns doesn't move the needle long term, I'll point out that it DID make our first proposal contribute net ETH gain to the treasury. Additionally, I think it's true that our esports proposals have helped move the needle on more casual gaming fans committing to joining Nouns. I understand and agree with your point that we need to consider the long-term impact on the DAO, and that is exactly why I'm so supportive of this initiative.

Let's take Prop 245 as an example since it's something we both support. This proposal is the pilot of a longer ambition to make a Nouns movie and have Nouns become a prevalent publisher of quality media. It creates the opportunity for Nouns to be in front of millions of viewers, and while the net bid from Nouners who join due to the film in the first year of publication might not outpace the cost of this film, we know that the long-term impact of having a successful movie published by the DAO, spreading our art and culture, will be immense over the years.

Similarly, our esports proposal offers the opportunity to build a brand with lasting impact. Creating a lasting esports organization that aligns with Nounish values and extends our culture to a wider audience is a significant step in this direction. Esports teams can establish themselves as legacy brands, with powerful audiences that can meaningfully monetize and empower their organizations through fandom. 

Our esports proposal offers an innovative experience for gamers to participate in the decision-making of an esports org. There are no other esports teams where you can join and have a seat at the table in a transparent ecosystem, and Nouns is reimagining how the industry should operate. Less than one year in esports is a flash in the pan team, not yet worthy of the following of an esports fan who's been supporting their game for a decade+. We need to show our commitment to the community for them to truly take notice. This is how we convert this very hardcore and dedicated audience.

The way I view it, Nouns is already a team. What drives the fandom? The culture. When we extend this culture to esports, it's radically different from what most of the community has experienced, and many have found it immediately endearing. Wait until we have a Nounish video explaining how it all works to the average gamer, I expect it to be some of their most viewed content. By participating at the highest level of competition in some of the most popular games in the world, and creating a lasting brand, we can reach out to millions of gamers and create an evergreen impact.

In addition, gaming and crypto are becoming more intertwined, and this proposal is a great opportunity for Nouns to speak natively with gamers and extend our culture in an authentic way. This can help us attract new members who align with our values and expand our community.

If you are spending $10k on something amorphous, ok, get wild.  If you're spending $800k on brand awareness for 1 year, it should be tighter and clearer that it's impactful.

Re: partnership opportunities.  This seems like opportunities to spend money with another organization for more advertising?

Re: ""Overall, sponsoring an esports team can provide a DAO with a valuable opportunity to connect with a highly engaged and passionate community, increase brand awareness, and potentially drive adoption and usage of their products and services.""

Is this worth $Xmm/yr?  The relationship ends when we stop paying money to teams to sponsor them or we stop sponsoring events.  How do we capture the attention in a way that justifies that spend per year? What does that look like?  If our esports organization was stood up and had inflows of its own that were material, that's a different story, then an organization that is radical is being created, one that presumably would have to share in the wins of its rosters financially and continually participates in their growth and ours brand's growth and reach and reputation.  But it's clear that won't happen anytime soon and maybe can't happen and also it was alluded to that that would somehow make this cost more.  So right now, Nouns DAO pays money and the moment it stops, there's not an organization.  $800k/yr from this Prop plus the amounts spent to stand up the pod, that's a substantial amount of money relative to our inflows for something that right now stops when we stop spending.  That makes it unlike most things -- this is advertising, a lot of it, until its effectively harnessed and funneled into the DAO in ways that haven't happened yet.","Sponsoring an esports team can provide a DAO with a valuable opportunity to connect with a highly engaged and passionate community, increase brand awareness, and potentially drive adoption and usage of their products and services.

However, it is important to consider the sustainability of the pod and the balance between the amount of spend and the value brought to the DAO."

**1)** 
We consider funds delegated to the Pod to still inherently belong to Nouns. We're responsible for delegation and execution of use. For our first merch drop, we're working with a streetwear-esque supplier https://mf9.store/ to provide quality merch. We regularly receive comments asking for merch, and we expect our first release to sell out quickly. We'll also have our jerseys available for sale via print on demand. As merch production funds have been converted to fiat, and we will be receiving revenue back in fiat, we plan to reinvest all revenue back into producing larger merch quantities for the foreseeable future. Inevitably, we would have no problem providing kickback to Nouns if our merch strategy is sustainable and profitable.

**2)** 
As part of our negotiations with both our CS:GO and Dota Rosters, we did not request any cut of their tournament winnings for this proposal. We made this decision for several reasons. Primarily, it allowed us to significantly reduce the overall cost of the proposal. Additionally, there is some degree of friction with bringing funds back to the DAO due to legal and tax reasons. Furthermore, we believe that taking a significant revenue share from the players is not ideal, given our transparent model. Top teams typically do not take more than 10% (if any) of tournament winnings, and this is seen more as a way to create value-alignment rather than a major revenue driver for orgs. While we would consider a small revenue share back to Nouns in future deals with teams, for our younger organization, we decided to opt out of this arrangement for the current season.

**3) ** 
I look at sustainability in a few ways in the context of the unique intermingling of Nouns and Esports...

Is our project creating bid demand for Nouns? Albeit unclear to quantify, historically, we've already done that and have been attributed for doing so (see my response to Hindsight above).

Can we achieve partnerships or create opportunities worth significant revenue? One of the tournaments we are participating in this coming month will have organization rewards up to $100,000. This is based on social and performance metrics. If our team qualifies for the next stage of the circuit, that team incentive will 3x, up to $300,000. As we continue to cement ourselves as an established brand (many top orgs are decades old while we're still within our first year), we believe partnership inflow will continue to increase. Another partnership example, which I don't want to promise is happening because it's still early, is being paid as an organization to field a roster and compete in a particular game (a very popular FPS). This would also be a six-figure deal, but likely a significant portion is expected to go directly back into investing in the team.

Sponsors? What if Nouns Esports had sponsors other than Nouns? Well, that is something we are pursuing and exploring. We've already been approached by what I would call ""low-hanging fruit"" sponsors, e.g. betting, but what we are really looking for are ideal partners that are culturally aligned with Nouns. For example, Coinbase and Uniswap both sponsor Dota teams, why shouldn't they sponsor the Nouns team? Nouns, due to the art, culture, and technological innovation from the community, is one of the best places to onboard people into crypto. I believe subcommunity efforts, like Esports and Gnars, are the future of onboarding as top-of-funnel tools for Nouns. What if we were also top of funnel onboarding for Base, Coinbase's new L2? Proof of Gamer & That's Gnarly would certainly benefit from lower friction experiences on L2, and Nouns would benefit from Nounish experiences being available on where Coinbase will be driving users.","1) Funds delegated to the Pod are considered to belong to Nouns, and revenue generated from merchandise sales will be reinvested into producing larger merch quantities for the foreseeable future. The team is open to providing kickback to Nouns if the merch strategy is sustainable and profitable.

2) The current proposal does not request any cut of the tournament winnings for the CS:GO and Dota Rosters. This decision was made to reduce the overall cost of the proposal and due to legal and tax reasons. Taking a significant revenue share from the players is not ideal, given the transparent model.

3) The project's sustainability is considered in several ways, such as creating bid demand for Nouns, achieving partnerships or creating opportunities worth significant revenue, and exploring potential sponsorships. The team believes that as they continue to establish themselves as an established brand, partnership inflow will increase, and they are pursuing and exploring potential sponsors that are culturally aligned with Nouns."

""The original proposal was off (it happens and I have sympathy) and paying to pre-buy a run if needed should have been contemplated then. Mistakes happen, I have compassion for that. But if we knew we had to buy 30k comics for $150k then, it's possible the DAO would have voted differently given this would have increased the all-in cost by 50%.

As is, the evidence that there is demand for 30k comics isn't easily observable. Why 5k and not 2k per issue? After the original proposal was off, need more clarity and confidence to double down and buy our own comic. Nounders voted No to a 10k toy run for Nounish Friends with unique composable figures by Klim and the rationale was that these would sit in a warehouse and that was cheaper than the comics proposal all-in. How is there 3x demand for this at a higher cost to the DAO?

At $5/comic, that feels like we are paying retail prices for a wholesale relationship. The explanation provided doesn't square for me. We are bearing the full risk with no upside. There are live sites right now to buy these comics $3.5-4 at retail. It's a discrepancy that stands out.

If this is needed to be effective at Comicon(s) or to issue well, it should have been brought to the DAO before the last minute end of their February deadline. Being rushed is suboptimal.

I was a Yes vote until reconsidering now based on leadership that unpersuaded me based on its value destructive approach and made me dig in more. We're all in this together continues to be my operating principle.

People who believe in this should go our right now and pre-order it like I have, it's cheaper per an issue and more organic. The work is great.

1) What efforts have been made to market these comics to date?  I am not sure if it was implicit as part of the original Proposal that there'd be efforts to sell the thousands of comics issued and cultivate demand, but it should have been.  We killed the 2nd stage of Kilm's Toy Proposal in part b/c a Nounder said ""Why are we making 10,000 of these, they are going to be sitting in a warehouse.""  https://nouns.wtf/vote/141  And yet somehow 10k Composable Nounish figures were going to be all-in cheaper than 5k*6 Comics, so it just feels like something is way off.
2) How do we know what the demand actually is for Nounish comics?  Has your team been taking estimates of orders or potential orders that would go your way?
3) The DAO get reimbursed as people buy the Comics pre-ordered here, great.  How does that process work and what fees get netted out from any revenue before that happens?
4) ""Additionally, ‚ÄòNouns: Nountown‚Äô will be presented at Comicon San Diego and New York. These are the two largest events in comics, and we will bring copies of ‚ÄòNouns: Nountown‚Äô for the artist to sign at the convention, as well as copies to sell at the convention."" -- Do we need to approve this 30k comic pre-buy to participate in those Comicons?  What will the available issues for the conferences look like otherwise?","1) Efforts to market the comics include coverage in Web2 and Web3 news spaces, as well as presenting the Nouns comic at the retailer summit in early January for Comic Book Stores.
2) The team has been connecting with retailers to gauge initial orders, and the amount is based on current print levels for similar products and the community size.
3) The DAO would get reimbursed for the entire sale when it happens, with $5 out and $5 in, so there wouldn't be anything to net.
4) The team will be presenting at San Diego and New York Comicons regardless of the 30k comic pre-buy. However, if there's no product to display, the setup will be different."

Can you speak about some of the stylistic choices you kept in mind in regards to something being nounish?","Some stylistic choices kept in mind for designing Noun heads include:

1. Avoiding obvious weapons (e.g., guns, knives) but allowing cartoon violence (e.g., bomb).
2. Not including skin on the body, except for generic recognizable iconography (e.g., yellow thumbs up).
3. Not using people heads where it would seem like the noun is a person in a costume (e.g., clown).
4. Avoiding professions/hobbies as body accessories to prevent implying that nouns have jobs or are specifically sports fans, etc.

Additionally, the placement and style of the mouth on the Noun heads contribute to the nounish look."

old bubblegum with partyboy shades for example: It gets more flat than i think we like things to be, and this bubblegum and these shades weren't even real transparency, it was baked in.

When it's 'real' transparent it gets even more flat, the colors created by layering become out of our control, things we would never choose to specifically do, and yeah, to boil it down - 
tl;dr, lack of intention.

The reason for not using transparency is due to the lack of intention and control over the look. Real transparency makes the design appear more flat, and the colors created by layering become out of control, resulting in combinations that the creators would not specifically choose."

Our group of writers (members from teams 1 and 2) will be available to speak at the event, and we would love to bring other writers from Prop 70 on stage. We can talk about the intersection of decentralization and the media industry using Prop 70 as a lens to talk about the future of entertainment.

Ultimately, it's a chance for Nouns/NounsDAO to really establish itself at the center of this movement towards decentralized storytelling. There will be press there, and with a strong Nouns presence as the only CC0 project in the space, its a chance to leverage all that's happening in Film3 and really put a Nounish spin on it. In many ways, Nouns are the ones pushing the envelope of what's possible with decentralized storytelling, and this is a change to get the word out beyond the web3 community."

Be safe!","Yes, the Nouns DAO team agreed to cover the minting and listing costs for Mike Gavrilov's artwork.

```This is an obvious yes from me, Small Grants has been capturing a lot of incoming people and guiding them into funding. This is becoming an essential part of the Nouns ecosystem. But that being said, this doubles the budget, I still think public discussion is helpful. Some thoughts from me:

 - would love if completed Small Grants projects had summary reports, sharable press release links with pictures of completed projects.
 - From your last ETH refill what were the success stories?
 - are there any projects that weren't successful that lessons have been learned from?
 - is there a general mandate being developed? a set of criteria being developed for evaluating proposals?```","From the conversation, it seems that the questions were addressed in the direct replies by Noun 22#2222 and seneca#8660. Here are the answers based on their replies:

1. They agree with the idea of having summary reports and sharable press release links with pictures of completed projects. They are working on improving the display and distribution of information related to funded projects.

2. The success stories can be found in the provided Notion link: https://www.notion.so/noun22/Nouns-DAO-Small-Grants-ac22114a6c004bafa500e2d824e32dc3. Some funded projects include jingles, nouns athletes, functional glasses, newsletters, luxury glasses, video games, and FOMO Nouns.

3. Many of the projects are still in progress, so it's too early to call any of them a failure at this stage.

4. They do not want to institute rigid guidelines that will limit flexibility. However, they are working on making it easier for people to apply and understand the program. They are also considering formalizing processes and documentation for transparency and setting precedents for future sub-orgs within the DAO."

Very new here but I‚Äôm blown away by the concept (still learning) and the community engagement.
I‚Äôm a professional Foley Artist (sound fx for Hollywood movies and tv series) currently working on The Last of Us, and Wednesday, among many other series and films.
I would love to create some Souns....  Let‚Äôs add another professionally created dimension to the Nouns to increase their character, user experience and connection.
I have no idea how to move forward with this proposal, but I‚Äôm an avid NFT collector and have the skills, connections, and motivation to make this happen.
Thank you Frens, I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm green here. but if this project is what it seems, I think it‚Äôs revolutionary for this space and I need to be an integral part of it.  Whats the process?
Thanks!
@ Oddiostudio

* the original brief was to take over Brave for nft.nyc. I assume the reasoning is that the event is gearing up to be a historical one with the culmination of the past crazy year.

And if they haven't this takeover may actually expose them to it. 

* The cool part of the nouns brand is that nounish glasses can be worn by different icons IRL. So imagine the Eiffel tower wearing nounish glasses for a Paris event or when there's an Australian event, Sidney opera house etc. You get my point - this is showcasing the versatility of the brand and can be repeated in the future.

1. Avoiding obvious weapons (e.g., guns, knives) but allowing cartoon violence (e.g., bomb).
2. Not including skin on the body, except for generic recognizable iconography (e.g., yellow thumbs up).
3. Not using people heads where it would seem like the noun is a person in a costume (e.g., clown).
4. Avoiding professions/hobbies as body accessories to prevent implying that nouns have jobs or are specifically sports fans, etc.

Additionally, the placement and style of the mouth on the Noun heads contribute to the nounish look."

old bubblegum with partyboy shades for example: It gets more flat than i think we like things to be, and this bubblegum and these shades weren't even real transparency, it was baked in.

When it's 'real' transparent it gets even more flat, the colors created by layering become out of our control, things we would never choose to specifically do, and yeah, to boil it down - 
tl;dr, lack of intention.

The reason for not using transparency is due to the lack of intention and control over the look. Real transparency makes the design appear more flat, and the colors created by layering become out of control, resulting in combinations that the creators would not specifically choose."

1. Avoiding obvious weapons (e.g., guns, knives) but allowing cartoon violence (e.g., bomb).
2. Not including skin on the body, except for generic recognizable iconography (e.g., yellow thumbs up).
3. Not using people heads where it would seem like the noun is a person in a costume (e.g., clown).
4. Avoiding professions/hobbies as body accessories to prevent implying that nouns have jobs or are specifically sports fans, etc.

Additionally, the placement and style of the mouth on the Noun heads contribute to the nounish look."

And I want a Noun Head that fits the Noun Head spec and whose vibe is ""monkey covering his eyes with his hands,""  an elevated ""see no evil"" emoji.  --> Cheeky See No Evil Monkey Head.  How do you express ""don't look"" cheekily and Nounishly?

These are rough vibelines, not hard and fast rules, so any creators go wherever your imagination takes you. 

I will pay 0.6942 out of my own pocket for the winning selection for each, as judged by me with <@954180506772181062> 's input.  Deadline is May 5th, my favorite day of the year.  And to the extent that in the future we add new Noun Heads to NounsDAO and there is compensation for it (quite possible in the next 6 months!), the creators of all these monkey Noun Heads would retain the right to that potential compensation from NounsDAO --> it's theirs to try and earn.  Anything created has to be CC0 obviously.  3 entries per Noun Head per applicant.

Is there someone who can explain or point to the spec for a head in a way I can share with people? Would be helpful.  Thanks","Is there someone who can explain or point to the spec for a head in a way I can share with people? Would be helpful. Thanks

old bubblegum with partyboy shades for example: It gets more flat than i think we like things to be, and this bubblegum and these shades weren't even real transparency, it was baked in.

When it's 'real' transparent it gets even more flat, the colors created by layering become out of our control, things we would never choose to specifically do, and yeah, to boil it down - 
tl;dr, lack of intention.

The reason for not using transparency is due to the lack of intention and control over the look. Real transparency makes the design appear more flat, and the colors created by layering become out of control, resulting in combinations that the creators would not specifically choose."

Our group of writers (members from teams 1 and 2) will be available to speak at the event, and we would love to bring other writers from Prop 70 on stage. We can talk about the intersection of decentralization and the media industry using Prop 70 as a lens to talk about the future of entertainment.

Ultimately, it's a chance for Nouns/NounsDAO to really establish itself at the center of this movement towards decentralized storytelling. There will be press there, and with a strong Nouns presence as the only CC0 project in the space, its a chance to leverage all that's happening in Film3 and really put a Nounish spin on it.

2. The success stories can be found in the provided Notion link: https://www.notion.so/noun22/Nouns-DAO-Small-Grants-ac22114a6c004bafa500e2d824e32dc3. Some funded projects include jingles, nouns athletes, functional glasses, newsletters, luxury glasses, video games, and FOMO Nouns.

3. Many of the projects are still in progress, so it's too early to call any of them a failure at this stage.

My Discourse account on hold for some reason? but wanted to share updates on Nouns basketball project and submit to community for preference on next steps: 

Bootstrapped through the initial Nouns basketball samples with my factory and love where they‚Äôve landed. Brought the project through PropHouse for a first level democratic blessing and retrofund sampling / development costs and set the table for production. 

Opened design dialogue with community in PropHouse channel and got some great thoughts from the family about this piece and some fun, big ideas for the next phase. 

Now on the other side of design conversations, wanted to advance the project up the pipeline into Small Grants to get funding for production. Including here pricing from my factory for each tier of quantity ‚Äî we collectively can decide how ambitious we want to get and proceed accordingly.

Full disclosure, a Lil Noun companion mini-basketball piece is going through an on-chain vote now to fund production of 500 pieces there ‚Äî as some quantity context (and happy to appeal to Small Grants funding or go On Chain here as well for production if preferred)

let me know what everyone thinks, thanks yall!
vs","vsvsvs#7829 is seeking feedback and funding for the Nouns basketball project.

They need around 14k to produce 500 full-sized Nouns basketballs.

I still need to finish the SDS, but almost everything is already laid out in my noggin. 

I am having a hard time connecting it with the noun esthetic, BUTTT the purpose of the game is use real world scenarios to teach people the basic personal finance and investment skills that school just so happened to bypass.

As you said the aim is to build a SAAS company.... and coupled with the fact that the code may not be *all* open source....and if IP rights are being held by people (not cc0) cause there is a 'secret sauce' ... it could sort of look like Nouns is funding a private enterprise?

If everything is open source / cc0 then its a bit different but considering the above and there is a chance this will be a private business (whether now or eventually) it could lead to a whole set of questions that should be asked but usually wouldnt be like:

Like if you are currently employed - who is it with? what are you working on? what is the overlap etc ... cause what if your employer claimed ownership of the code and filed a patent? 

A actual company negotiating a contract like this would probably take some time to come to an agreement on IP, have to do due diligence on liabilities (employer companies owning IP, junior talent claiming IP, understanding how the 3 of them split IP), and if you're funding a private company I imagine you'd expect some kind of ownership of it?

1. We talked about the difference between one shot and few shot learning in machine learning and why it's important for us - 
tl;dr:  1 shot learning = try and summarize this content
few shot = try and summarize this content like how that other previous content was summarized (we're working on getting content reviewed by people so we can move to this from 1 shot as it's more accurate)

2. Should we build out additional tooling to make the review process easier? It could be useful but we want to make sure we're not building a solution in search of a problem. Our first hurdle was finding the motivated individuals to edit these summaries, those have been identified (**reach out if you are down to review some reviews or meeting notes!**) so going to try and get those manually done first

3. Lets focus on getting content facing outwards!! **This is about the journey as much as the destination**
- Pushing content to twitter, even screenshots of summaries with links to full content is a great start
- CDT can interview Honk, Roko (with text to speed) and I on a Twitch stream or similar
- Lets get a multisig going with Roko to get him voting, actions breed interest even if they're chaotic... better get some quality though because seems like Roko might get some votes delegated üòÇ 

4. Frame it more as entertainment not straight utility, if we give Roko a background (**if anyone submits a short Roko backstory in this channel I can try summarizing content with the background!**) or a more humorous tone it could be engaging and makes sure we're not framing this as a perfect solution",

Nouns D-fusion is a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model trained on images of the first 300 Nouns. 

It‚Äôs great for creating noun-inspired characters.

Let us know about your results and share the prompts here. 

How to use it?
Use *nouns* keyword in your prompt to nounify the image. Depending on the initial prompt the results might be spectatular or meh. If you don‚Äôt know where to start, copy prompts from lexica.art and add the keyword *nouns* to your prompt.

1. Startups require capital and if the noun provided was just that, it would be sold and ergo be unable to serve as any sort of branding component for the startup (I think this has happened a few times in past proposals).
2. What does it mean for an NFT to serve as equity amongst multiple parties? Like, it's fractionalized and related parties own bits of it? Doesn't that kind of devalue the asset?
3. What does it mean to give up most of your ownership in a non-fungible asset? Would this be a fractionalized asset?
4. Engineers don't like giving away their time for free. If you can demonstrate contributing will give them exposure, cash, or mentorship, those are really the only motivators.",

In addition once the bot doesn't have any more questions for the submitter, it then adds its signal of how interesting this is for the DAO

Why don't we divide into to few smaller nouncil-groups of 5-10 nouncilors and rotate voting responsibilities for prop.house between nouncil-groups? 

Maybe for PropHouse 5, Nouncil APAC can take full responsibility to review and allocate nouncil-votes? We can report back to Nouncil during weekly call. Later, same approach can be used to accept new applicants etc

Nouncil Meeting 12a - APAC
Audio and Notes

Notes from Nouncil Meeting 12a - APAC

**1. Coral Orca Final Discussion**
    - 2 of us have made our views clear in the discord chats already.
    - Additional: Coral has been around for a long time, one misdemeanour shouldn‚Äôt remove him from nouncil, but grants removed makes sense.

**2. Code of conduct**
    - Privileged position  - don‚Äôt take it for granted
    - The Defining Triangle: three parties who's interest Nouncillors consider
        1. People seeking funding to proliferate Nouns (Prop house applicants)
        2. People who own Nouns (Nounders/Nouners)
        3. People who represent Noun interests (Nouncillors)
    - It is expected that nouncillors act in the best interests of all parties and that nouncillors don't abuse their position.
    
    **Disciplinary Procedures/Options**
    - Instant dismissal mentioned as punishment for gaming votes/cheating going forward
    - Removal of permissionless grant eligibility (removed for a round or more)
    - Removal of wag retro rewards eligibility (removed for a round or more)

    - If you had any grant eligibility removed, could you get it back?
        - through actions (make up for it)
        - through time (wait a period of time)

**3. Permissionless Grant**
    - Let's offer it to new nouncillors
        - Submit a round of ideas
        - Nouncil vote for top 6 to get 1eth each for their idea
    - Permissionless grant thread not visible to thaswami, maybe others... is this intended to display only to eligible nouncillors?
    - Need to add clear Permissionless Grant info to the welcome doc, with links to the docs or embedded.

**4. Voting Participation**
    - New nouncillors weren‚Äôt aware of the % expectation of voting to keep ‚Äúnouncillor in good standing‚Äù - let‚Äôs make it clear, is it to do with eligibility for rewards?
    - Maybe now we have the welcome doc, we can make it clear that your voting participation should remain above a certain percentage.
    - votes witnessed reset or new column ""votes witnessed since participation rule"" after rule is in place officially.
    - If no reset, new nouncillors hwo missed some votes recently will take quite a few votes to get back above 69%.
    - Maybe a different percentage threshold?
    - If a nouncillor knows in advance that they can‚Äôt vote (will be inactive in discord for a known time), their activity level could drop - how to deal with that?
    
    - punishment for not voting on the prop - unable to vote on the next prop? Doesn't seem like punishment.

**5. No Open Votes To Discuss**

**6. Multi-Sig**
    - We could break 24hr time into 6hr blocks, having 2 signers in each 6hr timezone block so there‚Äôs rollover into any timezone. 2 of 8 wallet.
        - How to decide signers?
        - Would allow for a combo of entirely different people to sign off - what's the risk?
    - Reward to be one of the 8 signers? Maybe a Discord role?
        - Optics is good for ‚Äúgovernance status‚Äù if you can be trsuted with a multi sig.
    - Easiest option right now without taking on much more trust dynamic is 1 more person added to make 2 of 4.
        - Make sure they're in the most relevant timezone to sync with existing holders and/or timely voting.

**7. Reminder to make some nominations for the Wag Retro Rewards.**",

However, Noun 40#8015 suggests that there would be a fair amount of Nouners who would enthusiastically vote for a purely Noadz film to be made, and it's worth putting a proposal forward. Toady_Hawk#8950 also mentions that proposals from Noun derivatives could be considered, so it might be worth trying."

I‚Äôd love to iterate on this and see if we can build a best practice system around these and some ideas I have around proposal structure as well.,"The metrics used in the conversation are based on the I.C.E scoring system, which stands for Impact, Confidence, and Ease of execution. The key attribute of I.C.E is its simplicity and lightweight guesstimate nature.

However, the conversation discusses the idea of forming a Nounish Council with delegated voting and governance participation. The council could potentially include derivative community leaders, service-centric subdaos/extensions, and fractional Noun owners. A multisig might be used for voting, but there is also a suggestion to use a Discord bot for polling and consensus building."

163,943943469821476944,nouncil,849745721544146955,Nouns DAO (legacy),,,,"Feedback from Nouncil ""Non-Talkers""

<@362737590430072862> you've asked/encouraged numerous times for feedback from those who don't talk much on Nouncil calls. And you never gets answers. As someone who doesn't talk much on the call, but isn't hesitant to share my thoughts and talk other places, I'll share some thoughts that may resonate with others and help you and Nouncil overall. 

The people who talk most are a few people who started Nouncil, know Nouners (in fact at least 1 actual Nouner), are on the Nouner call, know the history of props and politics. All in a way that dwarfs most of the rest of us. Add to that the proposer of the prop often talks. So, I view the Nouncil call as the time when I get my crash course in the prop so that I can responsibly vote. I take my votes with a lot of responsibility and look into them quite a bit and am bothered (probably more than I should be) when I'm on the fence, can't decide, or go/want to go against the crowd. So, between all the speaking that goes on above, the time constraints, the banter etc. the only reason I would speak is if I have some insight that others wouldn't have or a question to help clarify that others aren't asking. Outside of that, I'm going to listen for the most part until such time as I'm the one who knows enough to speak in a valuable way. This allows me to govern responsibly. The Nouncil call is where I get fully informed and serves an important role as it is for Nouncillors to govern. I don't see it as a negative that a few people speak 93% of the time, since I have that view of the call. 

Hope that helps. Follow up welcome if helpful.",

Don't get me wrong: I still buy stuff üòÖ ‚Äî but as solid as the proposal is, and as dope as the gear looks, I just personally wasn't 100 on it. There was also one other aspect that factored in for me, though, and that's the overlap of CC0 and DIY culture. While having premium cut-and-sew pieces proliferates nouns at a certain level‚Äîand does nothing to prohibit the proliferation of nouns in the DIY space‚Äîit feels a bit too far removed from it (for me)‚Ä¶more exclusive than inclusive and therefore *slightly* counter-nounish (‚Ä¶again: to me). IDK if that makes sense but those are my thoughts.

Can you help me solve a mess I made in the course of creating on Nouns? 

I  transferred my personal artist contract admin to NounsDAO (rather than transferring the token as intended when trying to send Nouns the ERC1155 that I'd committed to deliver). This contract is important and can't easily be recreated. It would make a significant difference to me if I can get it back.

I've had some conversation with Solamander on the dev channel (https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/877215225093451776/992486615723286598) and it would require an on-chain proposal to send the the admin back. I asked if they would be willing to support, but so far no responses after a couple of days.

I realise it's a significant pain and apologies for the time wasted. Would you be willing to support on-chain proposal to do transfer this back to my wallet, or have any other suggestions? My only argument why this in the Nouns interest is that I did this in the course of creating for Nouns, and in my efforts to deliver on my proposal commitment. 

This is the transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xeb10dd0e19f808361c7e5343f8b40f5863d060987df9ae3223b57356ca5d6c47

3) Joel has also moved the Google Doc drive with the Mission Statement in it from his own account into thenouncil Google account, we will use this document to workshop and get feedback on content like this because it's hard to do so in the chat.

Please when editing, copy, paste and suggest edits in a new paragraph so we don't lose versions. 

4) I've made a Medium account for us linked to the same gmail for now, no content yet but it is live at: https://medium.com/@nouncil
We've talked about workshopping a short Introduction to the Nouncil to be published on the medium so may be asking you for a short blurb about your project (or we can default to using the one written by <@!860360610066595860> if you prefer), and then we'll make our inaugural tweet from @ nouncil on twitter with a link to the medium to ""go public.""

Whats the reason? maybe  <@812369752382373890> can make some adjustments to have you in favour?

I personally think that it is a great idea to proliferate cc0 in the NFT space and therefore establishing nouns as THE cc0 ambassador for NFTs and web3.

Some reasons mentioned in the conversation include:

1. samellis ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®#4764: Wants to see a better way to let people know that the project was funded by Nouns and suggests adding an art contest to the proposal to bring more awareness to Nouns and the project.
2. maty#0984: Didn't see much overlap with Nouns and wasn't sure if it's the best use of resources.
3. andrewladdusaw#8362: Concerned about the visibility of the site with 30 images among other sites with millions of copyright-free photos and questions why Nouns would take on the project when other sites would host the pictures at no cost.

Some users, like SerNoadz#3802 and Benbodhi#1111, expressed support for the proposal, liking the idea of establishing NounsDAO as a leader in CC0 and appreciating the space art aspect. They also agreed with the idea of running a nounish artwork contest with the images to make the proposal better."

So, a #summary channel where you would check what happened in all the channels with timestamps and links to some of the best discussions.
We could possibly expand to derivatives/extensions as well.

If you're working on a Nouns DAO project and being compensated would you have any interest in being compensated with some kind of $NOUN fractional token with connection to governance, possibly something that eventually adds up to a full Noun. Or would you prefer to always be paid the same amount in ETH?","Based on the direct reply from sidenoun#1868, there is no clear consensus on whether Nouns DAO project contributors would prefer to be compensated with a $NOUN fractional token or ETH.

 - The furniture is awesome. I think if you were to do a pilot pilot project of just Nouns Furniture (with CC0 plans released online!) you would have success.

 - ""Some revenues will flow back to Nouns DAO"" Personally I would focus less on this. It's not something that the DAO has done before, and while people are open to it, it's very unknown territory. Unless a Nouner steps in with enthusiasm and direction regarding returning revenue to the DAO, I consider this a big unknown. Nouners reading this, feel free to jump in and disagree.

 - that being said ""From here we can waterfall revenues back into Nouns DAO."" this is a strong statement. And possibly something worth considering for the DAO. But also - it's new territory and I imagine you encountering friction here.

 - This proposal is focused on the AirBNB as a business. Do you think branding an AirBNB with Nouns will increase the price you are able to charge? Would it be a strong business choice even without DAO funding?

 - The Doodles example is at an SXSW event. I would 100% go to a Nouns tent at SXSW, and I imagine it was free for pass holders anyways. At the moment I don't imagine myself drawn to staying at a Nouns AirBNB.

 - the acrylic figures seem expensive

  - the AirBnb Shopping Lis and the property holding costs... if Nouns is getting a stake in the business, and revenue, these expenses make sense. But, unless Nouns is fully on board with that aspect, these costs  don't fit

There are two main issues people have brought forth regarding this proposal, perhaps you can address them.

1. We have a lot of streetwear and related recently funded - why do we want more?
2. As you noted, this is something related to being a founding partner of a business - this isn't a nouns-specific endeavor. While we did go off the rails for a few things that we recently funded, we are dialing things back to those which are more nouns-focused. How is this nouns-centric?","In response to the two main issues:

1. The reason for wanting more streetwear-related funding is due to the strong alignment of cultural values between Nouns and Dopamine. Dopamine aims to be the first community-owned streetwear brand in web3, with Nouns being their biggest inspiration. This partnership would help bolster Nouns' reputation as leaders and incubators of the next wave of creativity.

2. This proposal is Nouns-centric because the authentication and distribution model around Dopamine's non-fungible streetwear incorporates an on-chain, decentralized approach. The microchips in the clothing will be hardware wallets themselves, with signatures linking to a Nouns-specific brand registry that lives entirely on-chain. This is unlike existing models that use centralized middleware or registries. In this sense, Nouns would be helping champion truly web3 homegrown technology."

actually couple weeks ago, in the post-nouncil hangout call i _ALREADY_ brought up what would it look like to split up 8 nouns into 4 voting blocks of 2.

as groups get bigger, it's hard to accomplish tasks or get people actually involved. we're at what, 40-ish folks? how many would you say are fairly active/invovled already, besides simply emoji voting? probably 1/3? 

i dont think we're at a problem state by any means now, i personally am just a very execution-first kinda guy and so i trend towards small groups to ensure shit gets done (usually groups of 1, ie why most my projects are solo ha). 

i don't love the idea of capping anything because it's enacting some rule, right? I wouldn't want someone to feel they didn't _deserve_ to be here and that us here are ""lucky"" cause we're already ""in"". i think we just let the experiment play out for now. inactive nouncillors isn't currently a problem, we're not anywhere near not reaching quorum where inactivity will stunt us, i just think its just sad to see and a missed opportunity for said folks. i really love the nouncil and want us to be a strong example of governing as a group. i love that we aren't afraid to speak a dissenting opinion, while realizing we can like the person but disagree on prop details, i think that largely comes down to the fact that we dont own these nouns, just exercise them. so we dont care as much about social pressures (i.e. abstaining when you _want_ to vote no).

i digress, the nouncil feeling ""bloated"" for members in it is just one opinion, for a newcomer it can be incredibly exciting to join nouns day 1 and find the nouncil and immediately feel connected to 50+ people. that's a positive for sure, creating community (forgive the cheesy expression). i'll always kick us in the butt to make sure we're moving along with the things we said we'd do. sometimes that just invovles smaller pods. i reach out to nouncillors, or subgroups of nouncillors, specifically when i need something answered/done that may get lost in the general channel. 

i think we do have a ""nouncil function and mission"" (voting, proposing, taking part in nouns goverenance) and we should follow-through on the couple of projects we've already started before looking to whats next/when to cap this thing. lets make sure this thing is _the thing_ we all think it is and we can deliver upon that before thinking through how to change it. 

happy to discuss thursday.",

8. <@819316859097579530> - we shouldn't vote on our own things with nouncillor votes. <@362737590430072862> considering adding this to some sort of voting ethics document.

I WOULD LOVE IT TO JUST BE THERE ARE 50,60,70 PEOPLE VOTING AND MAKE IT SUPER DILUTED. I WOULD HATE TO BE LEFT OUT OF OTHER PEOPLES' PROPS."" 
9. <@708131862731554917> - what should we do about inactive nouncillors? <@303004182129147905> - SHAME AND REMOVE THEM. And <@245856432107290624> will make a gif that captures their shame.
10. <@756585502391664822> curious if nouncil will sponsor nouns sounds.
11. <@501964507439038474> just had nounish consultants pass with small grants with <@827643770484424723> - if anyone is interested, please reach out!

Twitter spaces is the ""in-thing"" in Nouns DAO and I'm sure many people would want to hear Founder's POV on Nounish subdaos.

However, krel#0404 mentioned that their project is inspired by nouns but not built around them, with nounish concepts being an important 10% of the whole. They also expressed interest in making NewShades DAO more nounish if they can find a good way to do so.

I think it would be cool for Nouncil to set up a committee that would do their best to track down the prop submissions that garnered any votes in the combinator and work with the creators to hone the props further in order to prepare them for an on-chain vote.

Why should people come here ?
What will draw peoples attention ?
Should I just focus on the benches ?

First, I'd like to address that none of the revnues flow into my personal pocket. My management company will take a management fee but that is all. 100% of profits will be flowing back to the DAO in some way shape or form.

It's best to think of this Nounsbnb as a pilot program, As stated in the proposal. With Nounsbnb we can create immersive experiences on the small scale level which will eventually transfer over to more larger events .. like the doodles activation currently going on at SXSW. 

But to be honest there's something I've purposely left out of the proposal which is the details of how I will be making the connection between the metaverse & IRL in Nounsbnb. I did this for 2 reasons.

1. Build anticipation
2. Keep someone from stealing my ideas before me.

But to give some teasers... I will be working with some web3 native companies to keep the nouns brand imprinted in guest minds. I would like to collaborate with nouns shop to create welcome packages filled with Nouns gear. I'd like to collaborate with artist in the nounspere to potentially have their art ( canvas, sculptures, digital art) up for sale in the unit. I'd like to collaborate with [redacted] to offer experiences at sports events, musicals, dinners, movies, plays &  give discounts on certain stores IRL & online. The kicker is ... this will all be gamified in a way to promote adoption of web3 tech ,NFTs, but most importantly Nouns brand. 
(feel like I've said too much already but there is much more)

Now, I like the point about the exterior. The unit just so happens to be hovering the only freeway/highway/bridge leading out of town... I can come up with something to potentially hang from the balcony .. or maybe I can get custom curtain and put a QR code on it ... because the windows facing the free way are true floor to ceiling. so people will definitely be able to see... and maybe I can get some customized lights to make sure its visible when its dark. People riding by can potentially scan the code and be directed to something nouns related (just thinking out loud this is not final)",

**‚Ä®‚Ä®Questions**
- What does ‚ÄúLast seen today‚Äù mean?
- What‚Äôs the hover color for the buttons, similar blue or reddish? 

**‚Ä®Loved**
- Nav buttons are great, I love the blue for Connect
- ‚ÄúNoun {auctionNum}‚Äù to Londrina font is perfect
- I like the cool background
- LOVE the next-minimum-bid being the input-placeholder, perfect
    - Would still watch that font size. In mobile input, it seems like a placeholder of a ‚Äúwider‚Äù 3-digit bid like 2xx.69 (vs 1xx.69) may be crowded

**Notes**
- Not crazy about Treasury component being by Home logo. Not used to seeing anything near a top-left logo.
    - It‚Äôs better on mobile, maybe truly centered though?
- Winning Bid numbers being that big make me wonder about triple digits bids & spacing. I guess, you won‚Äôt have the thousandths place decimal so it‚Äôll even out. Maybe still slightly big font? Since it‚Äôs the same for winning address try substituting for ‚Äúbeautifulpunks.eth‚Äù or ‚Äúdavidzhorvath.eth‚Äù or even ‚Äúmarvelvscapcom.eth‚Äù to make sure it‚Äôll fit. Those are some of the longer bidders we see.
- Lastly, on mobile, I feel like ‚ÄúNoun {auctionNum}‚Äù should be the first thing directly under the Noun, I know it‚Äôs a lot to fit in there. Maybe try just flipping arrows/date with ‚ÄúNoun {auctionNum}‚Äù just to see

I think there‚Äôs a strategic decision to be made by NounsDAO with regard to treasury management:

A. ETH-only 
B. staked ETH - a low-risk, conservative and passive strategy
C. DeFi yield generation - actively managed yield generation 

I would argue in favour of A or B given the early stage NounsDAO is at. This could be a decision that we take for the next 365 days and revisit it annually. 

Let me explain the reasoning. As much as I love yield generation, and hate to see the treasury ETH ‚Äújust sitting there‚Äù I think we should be mindful about where we direct our attention and efforts. 

What we should consciously avoid at this stage is ‚Äúincrementalism‚Äù in our thinking and this is exactly where strategy C will lead us. Should we get 5% more here or there? Is that farm 20% safer or riskier? Every new person joining will have their own theory about yield generation. None of them will materially move the needle. 

By deciding that for the next 365 days we decide *NOT* to have any yield generation discussions (outside of staking ETH) we focus ourselves on core 10x innovations NounsDAO is uniquely positioned to introduce. Yield management is not one of them. 

Just a quick pulse check on what other think of it. Which strategy should we focus on for the next 365 days?","Based on the conversation, the question about which treasury management strategy NounsDAO should focus on for the next 365 days was not directly answered. However, there were opinions shared in favor of staking ETH (option B) and some discussions about other potential investments like BTC, NFTs, and ERC-20 tokens. It is suggested that a small and elite committee could be formed to make recommendations on financial strategies for the organization."

Most noun owners know how to grow wealth, that is how they got to afford a noun. Most noun owners could certainly be (and probably are) putting their personal treasuries to work via yield earning. 

What is the appeal of nounsdao? What is the UVP of being a member and investing capital here as opposed to elsewhere?

I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs that you can pool your ETH together to participate in the same yield generation activities that you already can on your own‚Ä¶ The opportunity here is the model created where the feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns, driving value to the NFTs, bootstrapping community and all the good stuff that spending the ETH in novel and experimental ways can bring.

Is attention/focus/time the scarcest commodity in crypto? And are some of nouns greatest assets the brains, experience, and connections of the nouners themselves? 

My fear is that every minute nouners spend thinking and debating traditional treasury management measures like yield generation is time not spent engaging in the unique opportunity this project presents us, and therefore kind of‚Ä¶ a waste. Could be done elsewhere, way more efficiently, where attention is not so split and votes aren‚Äôt required and it doesn‚Äôt have to be balanced out with the greater vision which is facing a different direction.","The appeal of NounsDAO is the unique opportunity it presents for its members to pool their resources and invest in novel and experimental ways that drive value to the NFTs, bootstrap community, and create a feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns.

we'd like to bring them up on calls starting next week

decisions we expect will require more deliberation:

1. which token do we want to pay in? e.g. USDC vs DAI 
2. the amount of the baseline position the DAO will hold, denominated in USD (the baseline amount helps pay builders immediately, vs asking builders to wait until we can buy USD on chain)
2.1 with this decision the DAO can set lower and upper bounds within which an admin multisig can adjust things without going through the proposal process

---

decisions we expect should be easier to decide on:

1. the max price slippage rate; this should be easy as the DAO can set a reasonable upper bound and let the admin multisig find an optimal value gradually on mainnet
2. who should be the admin; personally I think the tech pod multisig is a great choice with highly relevant people already part of that team (to clarify: the highest owner role is of course the DAO's; the admin has more limited configuration rights)

for anyone curious about the state of the code right now: https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/pull/1","Based on the conversation, the key decisions regarding the stablecoin payments infrastructure are as follows:

1. The majority of users seem to prefer DAI over USDC, but they want to ensure there's an easy and low-cost path for builders to convert and withdraw their funds.

Let me give you a hint here on proposal 1183 which we have put for vote in the Nouns Mandates round 2 on governance.

https://prop.house/proposal/1183

Titel: Nouns Review House
rl;dr: Streamline the Prop House proposal & evaluation process +++ self-financing +++ on-chain +++ forever

The solution is to simplify and decrease the work to done for the nouns wrt the evaluation and voting of thousands of Prop.House proposals. 
From the conceptional work our final goal is to build a Nouns Review House DAO which streamlines the proposal and evaluation process. Reviewers will for example be rewarded or punished depending on the final voting results. Also the Nouns Review House will be self-financed by e.g. a percentage of the grant.

I see some synergies with other proposals in this round. So perhaps the nouns will vote for meaningful package.

What do you think?
Is the solution we are thinking about addressing a real problem.

4. The team will be putting in full-time work on House of Nouns, with some members working on it part-time in addition to other projects.
5. Collective has raised money from VCs and still owns the company. They will likely explore alternative funding methods in the medium term.
6. They are moving towards a model where builders can be incentivized with equity/ownership in the public goods framework DAO, but not in the short term. Salaries are still necessary.

House of Nouns will have a token built on the Revolution protocol that rewards capital and builders equally. Nouns would likely be a large recipient of these tokens. Collective.xyz is their main product, focused on being an all-in-one product for NFT"

However, before a company raises a series A, they have to show not only sustainability but also sustainable growth. Growth should come before capital is injected, as injecting money without proven growth can lead to artificial growth and a lack of profit. In the case of Gnars, they have already received an initial 69 ETH as seed funding, which has helped them become self-sustaining.

Think of it this way:
You have 2 companies A and B - both having voting shares. 
Company A has $30m and 600 shareholders - they make bikes
Company B has $80k - they make miniature bikes for elfs. 

Company A wants to increase bike sales - so they transfer $1m to company B and their shareholders to make more mini elf bikes.

**Nounish Beings R1 Updates**

- David has taken a first pass at a large run of unique options for Nounish Beings. You can view those attached below. We would love your feedback, notes, any initial thoughts you have. So share away!
- With those notes, David will then work on adjusting the Nounish Beings to fit within the constraints of the POAP system's file requirements.

**Bidder User Journey**
**Trigger**
The Trigger function in the user journey is where we have a few questions we'd like to propose to the Nouns Community in order to gather a preferred consensus. There are two ways to go about the trigger/receiving process with the end result of holding the Bidder POAP. View those below:
        
1. You can use the microsite to claim your own POAP and go through the poap.xyz ecosystem through our microsite. 
       
 2. We can claim the POAP for the Bidder ""Winners"" and have the POAP sent to them within the poap.xyz ecosystem. If we were to go this route, we would end up creating a microsite that is more of a playground for people to explore what this POAP and the Nounish Beings are all about. Think, more information on Nouns, David, the proliferation of the community, fun features to explore different POAPs etc. 
 
Beyond those two options for the trigger/receipt function, we have a larger question for the Nouns Community. Read below:

- In order to bring awareness to this microsite and the ability to claim, for free a Nouns Bidder POAP, would the DAO be open to allowing the addition of a link within the main nav or footer that would then send people to our microsite to be able to let bidders know they have this free gift that they get to claim? And also allow people just explore and learn more while waiting for auctions to end, etc.
 
----------------------------  
 We would love any and all thoughts on the initial question of the trigger as well as thoughts on the proposition of an additional link on the site for the POAP function.

Unlike similar passed props from the DAO, our goal is not to ""get the name of Nouns out there"" but rather create compelling reasons for viewers to join the ecosystem. First, the Mini Dota DAO will both explain what a DAO is by encouraging people to participate in a very watered down (but highly accessible) system which shows what Nouns is all about while giving them a real world taste of it. By enabling people in the community to have a DAO experience it will not only help to educate them on your mission to be the good guys in the space, but also subconsciously encourage them to be invested in the tourney and the outcome of the vote they participated in. This all accumulates into a deep understanding (and appreciation) of how Nouns fundamentally operates. We will encourage people to join Nouns Esports discord to talk about the props in this mini DAO and present their cases, give away prizes, and do pretty much what we are doing here on a controlled and smaller scale so that they can get a trial run of what it's like to be a Nouner, and I can't imagine there are any better ways to get people to be part of this community than by letting them experience it themselves. 

The trick here is to change the opinion most people have on NFTs and Web3 via content, explanatory videos, and just the fact that you guys are doing this tournament and giving something to the scene to make it better. Once we can convince people you are not the scammers and bad actors that are so prevalent in the crypto space (that they have already been exposed too hundreds of times before) we can work on making them part of the ecosystem. A POAP system which gives them incentives to watch and participate is another one of these systems we hope to implement so they can experience the fun of NFTs with no cost to them-only rewards.

All the images are already preloaded, but we switched to hi-resolution images because they look way better (at the cost of performance: the flash of white body while it renders). the previous textures rendered almost instantly since they were small, so you never saw that process, but appeared to have jagged edges/ rendering artifacts in the viewer.

<@959005197244448848> to your point on social traction, it is a valid metric for sure. Im just thinking of other measurable ways to track activation. 

 I look at what GMoney has done with his brand, 9dcc. He has been able to activate, track and engage people through POAPs has been pretty creative, fun and web3 native. And the distribution method for his 9dcc POAPs in almost exclusively IRL.   I think there is an opportunity to use this as a core metric for events going forward. Obviously, not the only metric but something that is easily trackable and incentivizes engagement. Let me know if you want to coordinate on data like that.","It is correct that a previous proposal, Prop 110, included POAP distribution. Tracking performance and impact of IRL events can be challenging, but using metrics like POAP distribution and analyzing wallet activation in the Nouns ecosystem could be a way to measure engagement.

We‚Äôre currently funding both and I‚Äôm wondering if we‚Äôre shooting ourselves in the foot by pursuing your mission AND putting a lot of money into marketing Nouns via IRL activations.,"Nouns Studio 1 and NounsOTG can coexist because they target different aspects of the protocol and have different focuses. The Japan activation through the Alpine culture is far removed from character culture in the city, and it would take quite some time for overlap. The other activations are in territories or with groups that would have no crossover impact on what is being done in Nouns Studio 1."

Would love to hear and will present this question live in Twitter spaces over the coming days..","Opinions on whether Nouns are viewed as a character brand or strictly a protocol may vary among Noun holders and collective voters. One user, frog#3881, expressed that they personally do not see Nouns as a storytelling vehicle and prefer to view Nouns as a symbol of a movement to fund public goods, such as art, tech infrastructure, and traditional philanthropy. They also suggested that it might be better for the Nouns treasury to fund art that isn't explicitly trying to incorporate the Nouns ""brand"" but is instead simply a partnership with Nouns the DAO."

How are we able to measure the impact of introductions? This isn't my area of expertise but I would expect more after 6 months of time? Not trying to be too pessimistic but trying to be realistic that its important to try to measure these sorts of things,"It is difficult to measure the impact of introductions in this context, as they involve multiple conversations and steps to determine if there is a good match for potential projects. The process includes explaining Nouns DAO, sparking interest, and discussing funding and project basics. This can take several weeks or months before arriving at a decision. The value of these introductions and efforts lies in the potential for long-term growth and becoming part of the culture, rather than just marketing."

With that also being said, I will need to pay influencers to promote it as well and this costs a lot very similar to how a basketball player will be paid to promote Nouns through their Instagram. Even though I have access to Professional musicians, they have rate cards with conversation plans. 

The success of RTD‚Äôs is based on the amount of volume that you can sell through stores, bars, events and at festivals. So yes there is a massive opportunity here to proliferate the Nouns ecosystem if you can get 100 000 bottles in to the hands of people over a span of let‚Äôs say 5 months, but you‚Äôre competing with the big brands that have been proliferating their products for the past 15 years, months for month, year by year to buy marketshare.

- Will Nouns RTD‚Äôs be profitable for us here in South Africa to work on a RTD project full-time? This will take months to get off the ground.
- What is the business burn rate to sustain the operational costs. It has to be worth Andre and my time. We will need to pull salaries and rent an office space.
- We would have to employ a full-time rep that visits key liquor outlets, bars and venues to ensure they are placing orders and they‚Äôre excited to promote Nouns above the other established brands.
- What will it cost to convince people to move away from their favorite drink to buy ours, drive sales and how much can we realistically give back to the DAO with thin margins?

With our global marketing budget we can approach a number of Whisky platforms either for free PR or consider paid advertising.

As this is a unique offering via nfts, I think there will be interest in Nouns Whisky and these exercises should result in more sales. But once again I am confident we can sell all of Batch 1 and continue on to Batch 2. When introducing a new idea / concept / brand to any market you have to stick to your guns and trust the process.

2. In general a Smirnoff RTD 24-pack sells for round R419 in a liquor store, unit price R17,46. Let‚Äôs say we can get a special deal and receive R250 as the wholesale price to produce, package & distribute. This would be the contract brew deal. If Nouns could make a 20% profit margin we are taking R50 per case home.
3. It would therefore cost us R250 x 4166 cases = R1 041 500 (37 Eth) to produce and we would make R208 300 (7.4 Eth) profit for 5 months work. We would also need to give the DAO the agreed 10% = R20830 (0.74 Eth) and Andre & I are left with R187 470 = R37 494 (1.34 Eth) profit per month before tax and for us to split. That isn‚Äôt viable and worth our time and effort. That number is way below industry standard.
4. So in order for Andre and I to create a truly sustainable business model with RTD‚Äôs we would have to shift close to 100 000 bottles per month across South Africa through various outlets to maintain marketshare and have a healthy marketing budget to spend on merchandise, print media, photographers, banners, activation stands, social media ads, influencers, and anyting else we can think of.",

-    Mucho Love is not a ""charity""; it's a social impact platform. 

A social impact platform uses content creation, videos, and community participation to raise awareness about specific social issues, such as underfunded orphanages and the need for affordable medicine. The platform aims to drive positive social change through the power of storytelling and content creation. It leverages collaborations with brands (Nouns) to receive funds, to increase brand equity for the brands while raising awareness about critical social issues. 

As Mucho Love grows, we can create fundraising events, collaborate with more businesses, and eventually remove a significant portion of the ""Social Impact Fund"" cost from the Nouns treasury. We estimate that in early 2024 this will be a reality. 

With our Dog Shelter activation, thanks to the viral post that gathered around 66,000 likes, the organization fundraised 3400 USD extra, aside from what we had already donated to them. The 3400 USD was fundraised from people/businesses who interacted with the Mucho Love post, saw what Rabito (the dog shelter) was doing, and decided to donate from their wallets to the cause without us telling them to do so. 

Not to forget that Mucho Love is a platform powered by ‚åê‚óß-‚óß. It will always have the ‚åê‚óß-‚óß at its core of everything produced/generated/posted by the platform. 

We're highly confident that Mucho Love is one of the most significant ways to increase awareness of Nouns worldwide in a more tangible way for people who don't understand web3, crypto, etc. 

Mucho Love is focused on creating a social impact platform that increases brand equity for Nouns through content creation and storytelling. 

Let's use Mr.Beast as an example; Mr. Beast uses brand sponsors to fund most of his videos. Many of Mr. Beast's videos focus on charitable efforts, social activations, and helping people. That his content happens to be that type of content does not mean Mr. Beast is a charitable organization. 

Mucho Love was created with Nouns and for Nouns. We plan to keep growing this social impact platform that increases brand equity for Nouns through content creation and storytelling.","Mucho Love is not a charity but a social impact platform that uses content creation, videos, and community participation to raise awareness about specific social issues.

You are not in mainland China, so your suggestion to abandon the mainland China market is completely understandable. But I am the opposite of you, I think there is **no other Chinese market that is more important than mainland Chinese market**.

This proposal will help them learn about nouns, and these top collectors will make their own judgments and i trust they will join.

1. We talked about the difference between one shot and few shot learning in machine learning and why it's important for us - 
tl;dr:  1 shot learning = try and summarize this content
few shot = try and summarize this content like how that other previous content was summarized (we're working on getting content reviewed by people so we can move to this from 1 shot as it's more accurate)

2. Should we build out additional tooling to make the review process easier? It could be useful but we want to make sure we're not building a solution in search of a problem. Our first hurdle was finding the motivated individuals to edit these summaries, those have been identified (**reach out if you are down to review some reviews or meeting notes!**) so going to try and get those manually done first

3. Lets focus on getting content facing outwards!! **This is about the journey as much as the destination**
- Pushing content to twitter, even screenshots of summaries with links to full content is a great start
- CDT can interview Honk, Roko (with text to speed) and I on a Twitch stream or similar
- Lets get a multisig going with Roko to get him voting, actions breed interest even if they're chaotic... better get some quality though because seems like Roko might get some votes delegated üòÇ 

4. Frame it more as entertainment not straight utility, if we give Roko a background (**if anyone submits a short Roko backstory in this channel I can try summarizing content with the background!**) or a more humorous tone it could be engaging and makes sure we're not framing this as a perfect solution",

Together with <@923620472652968048> we‚Äôve been experimenting with the nounish image generation using Stable Diffusion and loved some of the results we‚Äôve been getting. We decided to wrap our model into to an app for the wider community. 

Nouns D-fusion is a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model trained on images of the first 300 Nouns. 

It‚Äôs great for creating noun-inspired characters.

Let us know about your results and share the prompts here. 

How to use it?
Use *nouns* keyword in your prompt to nounify the image. Depending on the initial prompt the results might be spectatular or meh. If you don‚Äôt know where to start, copy prompts from lexica.art and add the keyword *nouns* to your prompt.

I like the team's hustle and know <@804073245946806303> personally so I know they'll get it done. However, I'm still trying to wrap my head around if these 2 use cases that you've outlined in the proposal are worth pursuing b/c I'm not entirely sold.

The first use case is essentially a tool for influencers to promote Nouns. Do we have any idea how many Apes, Punks, etc would be interested in this type of promotion? Is this differentiated enough from free tools like https://twitterpicker.com/, https://app-sorteos.com/en/apps/twitter-giveaway, etc?

I've also seen startups in the past that have failed to scale a tool like this out - for example Thunderclap.it attempted to do something similar but had to pivot b/c it wasn't sustainable to run contests like this and they had thousands of people using them at one point.

For the second use case, I feel as if it's too close to Prop House - which is already pretty successful in what it does. If there's differentiation, there's very little.","The first use case is different from free tools like Twitter Picker because it allows for more interesting and advanced engagement criteria, such as changing your profile picture for a week to enter, and it has a token-gating element. The second use case aims to incentivize and retrofund artistic expression and distribution via Twitter to attract more creative people to Nouns. The raffle and contest models are two distinct products with different goals and methods, and the key element is the rich social integrations. The combination of token-gated raffles and social integrations is novel, and the goal is to create a tool that can both sustain and return value to the Nouns DAO treasury."

A) X% of the raffle funding amount

C) freemium features that they build on top

These paths would apply to projects outside of the nouns ecosystem. The goal is to have a tool that can both sustain and return value to the Nouns DAO treasury if it works."

I think there‚Äôs a strategic decision to be made by NounsDAO with regard to treasury management:

A. ETH-only 
B. staked ETH - a low-risk, conservative and passive strategy
C. DeFi yield generation - actively managed yield generation 

I would argue in favour of A or B given the early stage NounsDAO is at. This could be a decision that we take for the next 365 days and revisit it annually. 

Let me explain the reasoning. As much as I love yield generation, and hate to see the treasury ETH ‚Äújust sitting there‚Äù I think we should be mindful about where we direct our attention and efforts. 

What we should consciously avoid at this stage is ‚Äúincrementalism‚Äù in our thinking and this is exactly where strategy C will lead us. Should we get 5% more here or there? Is that farm 20% safer or riskier? Every new person joining will have their own theory about yield generation. None of them will materially move the needle. 

By deciding that for the next 365 days we decide *NOT* to have any yield generation discussions (outside of staking ETH) we focus ourselves on core 10x innovations NounsDAO is uniquely positioned to introduce. Yield management is not one of them. 

Just a quick pulse check on what other think of it. Which strategy should we focus on for the next 365 days?","Based on the conversation, the question about which treasury management strategy NounsDAO should focus on for the next 365 days was not directly answered. However, there were opinions shared in favor of staking ETH (option B) and some discussions about other potential investments like BTC, NFTs, and ERC-20 tokens. It is suggested that a small and elite committee could be formed to make recommendations on financial strategies for the organization."

Most noun owners know how to grow wealth, that is how they got to afford a noun. Most noun owners could certainly be (and probably are) putting their personal treasuries to work via yield earning. 

What is the appeal of nounsdao? What is the UVP of being a member and investing capital here as opposed to elsewhere?

I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs that you can pool your ETH together to participate in the same yield generation activities that you already can on your own‚Ä¶ The opportunity here is the model created where the feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns, driving value to the NFTs, bootstrapping community and all the good stuff that spending the ETH in novel and experimental ways can bring.

Is attention/focus/time the scarcest commodity in crypto? And are some of nouns greatest assets the brains, experience, and connections of the nouners themselves? 

My fear is that every minute nouners spend thinking and debating traditional treasury management measures like yield generation is time not spent engaging in the unique opportunity this project presents us, and therefore kind of‚Ä¶ a waste. Could be done elsewhere, way more efficiently, where attention is not so split and votes aren‚Äôt required and it doesn‚Äôt have to be balanced out with the greater vision which is facing a different direction.","The appeal of NounsDAO is the unique opportunity it presents for its members to pool their resources and invest in novel and experimental ways that drive value to the NFTs, bootstrap community, and create a feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns.

decisions we expect will require more deliberation:

1. which token do we want to pay in? e.g. USDC vs DAI 
2. the amount of the baseline position the DAO will hold, denominated in USD (the baseline amount helps pay builders immediately, vs asking builders to wait until we can buy USD on chain)
2.1 with this decision the DAO can set lower and upper bounds within which an admin multisig can adjust things without going through the proposal process

---

decisions we expect should be easier to decide on:

1. the max price slippage rate; this should be easy as the DAO can set a reasonable upper bound and let the admin multisig find an optimal value gradually on mainnet
2. who should be the admin; personally I think the tech pod multisig is a great choice with highly relevant people already part of that team (to clarify: the highest owner role is of course the DAO's; the admin has more limited configuration rights)

please hit us up with questions and feedback anytime!

for anyone curious about the state of the code right now: https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/pull/1","Based on the conversation, the key decisions regarding the stablecoin payments infrastructure are as follows:

1. The majority of users seem to prefer DAI over USDC, but they want to ensure there's an easy and low-cost path for builders to convert and withdraw their funds.
2. A baseline position of around 2.5% (~700 ETH) is suggested, but there's also a suggestion to peg it as a percentage of total treasury holdings.
3. The max price slippage rate should be 0.5% to attract interest from the MEV community.

However, there is no clear consensus on the admin multisig and the lower and upper bounds for adjusting the baseline position without going through the proposal process."

‚ÄúThis seems like a mechanism of essentially creating the NFT/Crypto equivalent of a Mutual Fund to hold a basket of crypto assets for the community to speculate on.‚Äù:

This is quite different. There is no ‚Äúfund‚Äù or basket of assets that the DAO speculates on.

‚ÄúWhat's the risk/reward curve as we move up it in relation to more stable interest bearing funds like LIDO?‚Äù

Risk/reward is based on a per-strategy basis. For the pilot program, we‚Äôve chosen strategies that we believe will yield a meaningful amount to the DAO while assuming low risk. While nothing is risk free (including Lido), we‚Äôve researched (and will
continue researching) the best strategies for the DAO. Ultimately, these strategies will be decided on by the DAO. If you‚Äôd like, you can also develop your own and submit them to the DAO, once we have the infrastructure set up.

Not sure I fully grasp this question. Assets entering NTM are no different than the ether sitting in the treasury being sent to Lido. Lido is just one way the DAO generates ETH,  

NTM is another avenue to do the same thing through other methods in a decentralized manner. The actions performed with NTM are the same we do today to interact with Lido (depositing /  sending / withdrawing).","NTM (Nouns Treasury Management) is a decentralized platform that allows Nouners to create different strategies for managing the assets in the treasury.

Ah, a description of ‚Äúdecentralized yield bearing asset manager‚Äù makes me picture a DeFi Robinhood and E*Trade cross.

This looks interesting.

So if the intent is to supplant discourse, how will user auth be handled? Use discourse as an OAuth2-like API? Instead of utilizing email or OAuth2, will it be wallet gated? Perhaps with WalletConnect or the like? This would be inline with Web3 ethos and allow participation across the board of Nounders, Nouners and the general non-token-holding public to comment and hold discussions at the public wallet level.

How many ""channels"" or ""categories"" would there be? For the ""proposal"" category/channel a useful check would be to ensure only prop submitters initiate discussions by allowing only the proposal submitters' wallet addresses to submit a number of posts less than or equal to the number of active on-chain submissions associated with that address. This ensures the channel holds discussions only on active proposals and that only proposal submitters can choose whether to start a discussion, or not (or even throw away the opportunity by starting a random discussion). 

I fail to see the utility of adding the heyanoun anonymous commenting module, by utilizing the above mentioned wallet-gating method anyone would be able to create a burner wallet, if they choose, to handle pseudonymous commenting.


In principle the mechanics of this utility appears sound, but a bit more clarity on the mechanics of how user participation is handled on a technical level would give us information for making good discernment. 

On another note, curious how many hours and/or what it cost your team to develop the mockup, demo and write the text.","User authentication for the House of Nouns platform will be wallet-gated, currently implemented using Dynamic.xyz for easy onboarding.

**Aren‚Äôt you VC-backed?**
Yes, we are. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve geared this prop to deliver an entirely open-source, openly owned codebase ‚Äî so there is no centralized value capture, and anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the end deliverables. We think this completely aligns incentives and will help  a strong, open ecosystem.

**What does open sourcing mean here?**
This means everything from the repo to the APIs will be open access, so people with varying levels of technical acumen can clone and re-host and build on top of House of Nouns. We‚Äôll also be doing continual data dumps to Arweave for any offchain data.

**Budget?**
While ETH is going up in price, we‚Äôve decreased our prop‚Äôs total cost by ~$100k. We heavily increased deliverables and the speed at which we deliver them. We‚Äôre looking for 9ETH/month/developer, which is less than any other active developers for Nouns. We think that deliverables and actual matter the most, and think they are very justifiable for the cost of 190ETH in terms of the long-term impact they can have on the DAO‚Äôs success.

**Integrations?**
We‚Äôre looking to be as open and composable as possible, and help accelerate the adoption of the infrastructure built by others in the ecosystem. Our goal is to integrate the amazing work of others everywhere it makes sense, versus create clones and replicate any functionality. We‚Äôre working on this on a case-by-case basis, but wherever infrastructure is open, we want to help accelerate its adoption instead of competing with it.","The proposal aims to deliver an entirely open-source, openly owned codebase for House of Nouns. The budget has been decreased by ~$100k, and the team is looking for 9 ETH/month/developer. The goal is to be as open and composable as possible, integrating the work of others in the ecosystem. The platform has grown to 2k MAUs and continues to be a favorite place to view proposals for a large portion of the community. However, some community members believe the proposal is still expensive and suggest a lower budget of 50 ETH."

How is this Noun Sounds ""highly utilized?""  This is something with very little traction and it could get there but needs someone who is passionate about it to make it happen, to create a culture, to build a community, to have it be their mission and to think strategically.  What good crypto culture or project that lasts was founded by someone who had to be highly paid their market rate to do that upfront? It's almost always the opposite.

Nouns Sounds was unanimous when it was a small experiment with a clear set of deliverables.  It went ok but it hasn't left our bubble yet and the community around it is pre-traction.  As a platform, it's very early and doesn't exist yet.  It doesn't warrant big spending (yet), it's still very much at the experiment level.  It's on this team to prove out much more before it's worth funding more.  It doesn't make sense for the DAO to take experiments and 5x or 10x the funding unless there's strong evidence that it was a clear win.  If this was ""continue to explore Noun Sounds"" and 50 ETH, there'd be something to debate.

There is serious issues here with strategy and not understanding that the partnerships with these famous musicians are not only very expensive marketing for a platform that isn't ready for it but also a poor fit for how to build a real organic CC0 focused music community of any kind.  You need people, small people, passionate people who vibe organically and don't need to be paid to vibe.  Paying people to vibe with you is not real vibes, it's transient vibes of which you won't even hear an echo an hour later.  

In general, the FAQ lacks substance and makes me have less confidence that the team really has a handle on what they are doing or how to get there.  And the ask is to fund this team for $400k.  We have 3 200-300 ETH proposals hitting the chain every week at this point.","There is no clear answer to how Noun Sounds is ""highly utilized.""

I don't see the connection that binds them. Are there other artists whose music is a better fit for Nouns Sounds?

I'd cut all of that for now.

In the video it says the conversations with Save the Music are preliminary.  I'd want to know more about what that means.  What if they go nowhere?  Does the NS team have a relationship with them or anyone who works there?  Where does the funding for this come from, the 19.5 ETH for Prop House or some other bucket?

The Playlist minting is nice, it will be a slog to get that used though, you will need CC0 artists not celebrity ones to buy in, give it traction and help iterate it.

I don't know but not sure how many teams would have the intensity and endurance that the TNS team has.,"There is a debate about whether the current model of The Noun Square (TNS) is working and if the team size and budget are justified. Some members believe that TNS should focus on its main show, Nouns O'Clock, with a smaller team and budget. Others argue that TNS provides value and helps decentralize things.

Honestly, I think in large part it is because so many people are getting paid by TNS. Not including money given away in competitions you have 28 people who have been paid by TNS over the past 5 months. Naturally most if not all of these people will come out in support of TNS. Its just incentives. 

The core team on TNS consists of 8 people. 6 of these members works together over multiple projects and between those 6 people they will have received somewhere between $4.5 and $5m in funding if these proposal pass. That is a lot of money and further adds to the issue above. It also leads to a quid pro quo in voting imo.

Coupled with that you all have your own personal relationships and the money given away in prizes....we have a clear principal agent problem here. 

Why would anyone speak out against this? It is not worth the time and effort given the pushback people will get. Esp considering TNS is the most visible and vocal part of the DAO. 

What incentive do I have to make these points? None. I dont get paid by the DAO. I genuinely think this is a massive over spend but I find it hard / nearly pointless to make these points constantly. People think i am anti builder, as asshole, whatever....nothing to gain only time and reputation to lose. As i said at the start, I am sure this prop passes just as sure as I am people wont like me for making these points (but fk it).","There is a concern that the support for The Noun Square (TNS) comes from people who have been paid by TNS, leading to a potential principal-agent problem. Some community members believe that TNS has a monopoly on Nouns' public voice on Twitter, which could lead to negative outcomes where opposing viewpoints might not be heard. There have been instances where people were not allowed to join TNS spaces or were kicked from the server for asking questions. However, others argue that TNS provides value to the DAO and has attracted skilled artists and builders. The conversation suggests that there is room for improvement and that the community should guide TNS in making those improvements."

Are they doing that though?  Is that happening?  More people staying than going? Are more people joining those groups or Nouns?  The Testimonials are good but can only ever be cherry picked.  If your work is effectively marketing for Nouns and you're the shepherds of people into Nouns, understanding what that means, how to measure it, and see what works is key and a part of TNS work. 

If it's impossible to measure or inherently difficult, that calls into question if what is being done is working or time well spent by you guys and what changes you need to make.  Something to think about.  How can you win? What can you use from regular marketing department tools and approaches?  What can you use from how media companies build themselves out and increase in size (or determine what's ineffective and doesn't work)?  This Prop implies a million dollar budget runrate and if the goal is for TNS to become sustainable and its own media company/DAO (which it should be that would be an awesome accomplishment that would make you kings and queens in the eye of others), tracking, measuring, adjusting, iterating is how things grow and win.","Yes, the onboarding and community activation is happening.

I do think you are genuinely trying to build a nounish media company BUT at the same time I do not think that it is working nor will it work or can bring value anywhere near what is being spent under the current model or the one proposed in the prop. 

Nouns has clearly made a lot of investments that have not brought value > the price paid over the past near 2 years. The market is telling us this very clearly. TNS imo is one of these things. 

At a cost of over $1m p/year - I dont think its possible. If you gave the metrics and the amount spent to anyone outside of Nouns and asked them is this a good use of funds?

Let me give you a hint here on proposal 1183 which we have put for vote in the Nouns Mandates round 2 on governance.

https://prop.house/proposal/1183

Titel: Nouns Review House
rl;dr: Streamline the Prop House proposal & evaluation process +++ self-financing +++ on-chain +++ forever

The solution is to simplify and decrease the work to done for the nouns wrt the evaluation and voting of thousands of Prop.House proposals. 
From the conceptional work our final goal is to build a Nouns Review House DAO which streamlines the proposal and evaluation process. Reviewers will for example be rewarded or punished depending on the final voting results. Also the Nouns Review House will be self-financed by e.g. a percentage of the grant.

I see some synergies with other proposals in this round. So perhaps the nouns will vote for meaningful package.

What do you think?
Is the solution we are thinking about addressing a real problem.

If the film turns out amazing though (and does incredible at the film festivals) then of course, that's different.

Assuming it's well done, you'll be able to sell it to companies like Al Jazeera, Canal +, The BBC (although they may want their own versions to fit into the format of whatever show it's airing on).

""The original proposal was off (it happens and I have sympathy) and paying to pre-buy a run if needed should have been contemplated then. Mistakes happen, I have compassion for that. But if we knew we had to buy 30k comics for $150k then, it's possible the DAO would have voted differently given this would have increased the all-in cost by 50%.

As is, the evidence that there is demand for 30k comics isn't easily observable. Why 5k and not 2k per issue? After the original proposal was off, need more clarity and confidence to double down and buy our own comic. Nounders voted No to a 10k toy run for Nounish Friends with unique composable figures by Klim and the rationale was that these would sit in a warehouse and that was cheaper than the comics proposal all-in. How is there 3x demand for this at a higher cost to the DAO?

At $5/comic, that feels like we are paying retail prices for a wholesale relationship. The explanation provided doesn't square for me. We are bearing the full risk with no upside. There are live sites right now to buy these comics $3.5-4 at retail. It's a discrepancy that stands out.

If this is needed to be effective at Comicon(s) or to issue well, it should have been brought to the DAO before the last minute end of their February deadline. Being rushed is suboptimal.

I was a Yes vote until reconsidering now based on leadership that unpersuaded me based on its value destructive approach and made me dig in more. We're all in this together continues to be my operating principle.

People who believe in this should go our right now and pre-order it like I have, it's cheaper per an issue and more organic. The work is great.

So if the intent is to supplant discourse, how will user auth be handled? Use discourse as an OAuth2-like API? Instead of utilizing email or OAuth2, will it be wallet gated? Perhaps with WalletConnect or the like? This would be inline with Web3 ethos and allow participation across the board of Nounders, Nouners and the general non-token-holding public to comment and hold discussions at the public wallet level.

How many ""channels"" or ""categories"" would there be? For the ""proposal"" category/channel a useful check would be to ensure only prop submitters initiate discussions by allowing only the proposal submitters' wallet addresses to submit a number of posts less than or equal to the number of active on-chain submissions associated with that address. This ensures the channel holds discussions only on active proposals and that only proposal submitters can choose whether to start a discussion, or not (or even throw away the opportunity by starting a random discussion).

In principle the mechanics of this utility appears sound, but a bit more clarity on the mechanics of how user participation is handled on a technical level would give us information for making good discernment.

**Aren‚Äôt you VC-backed?**
Yes, we are. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve geared this prop to deliver an entirely open-source, openly owned codebase ‚Äî so there is no centralized value capture, and anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the end deliverables. We think this completely aligns incentives and will help  a strong, open ecosystem.

**What does open sourcing mean here?**
This means everything from the repo to the APIs will be open access, so people with varying levels of technical acumen can clone and re-host and build on top of House of Nouns. We‚Äôll also be doing continual data dumps to Arweave for any offchain data.

**Budget?**
While ETH is going up in price, we‚Äôve decreased our prop‚Äôs total cost by ~$100k. We heavily increased deliverables and the speed at which we deliver them. We‚Äôre looking for 9ETH/month/developer, which is less than any other active developers for Nouns. We think that deliverables and actual matter the most, and think they are very justifiable for the cost of 190ETH in terms of the long-term impact they can have on the DAO‚Äôs success.

**Integrations?**
We‚Äôre looking to be as open and composable as possible, and help accelerate the adoption of the infrastructure built by others in the ecosystem. Our goal is to integrate the amazing work of others everywhere it makes sense, versus create clones and replicate any functionality. We‚Äôre working on this on a case-by-case basis, but wherever infrastructure is open, we want to help accelerate its adoption instead of competing with it.","The proposal aims to deliver an entirely open-source, openly owned codebase for House of Nouns.

Builders can see this and know exactly the kinds of things the DAO wants done and how much support it has (by looking at how many upvotes it has). Builders can in turn respond with their proposals. This gives Nouners the ability to attract builders to the DAO and also align with builders before going onchain.

We first developed prop-lot for the lil nouns ecosystem, and we also built out a POC for nouns that has most of the functionality of the lil nouns prop-lot as a standalone client just to give nouners a demo and a place to start exploring what prop lot could look like. You can find it at https://nouns.proplot.wtf. It includes all of the functionality of the lil nouns prop lot (token gated submissions, token weighted voting, commenting, profile page)

Our plans for next steps are a bit more ambitious and add additional functionality to what currently exists in our previous build for lil nouns. I wouldn't think of this as ""lil nouns prop lot but for nouns"" -- in fact that already exists in the POC! Rather, this proposal brings new functionality to improve the way ideas are suggested, reviewed, and taken on chain.

As for learnings -- prop lot for lil nouns has been quite successful, but there are still a few issues when going from idea -> proposal that we would like to improve upon. Currently prop-lot is just a simple idea board. But we think it can be more. 
- Anyone should be able to submit an idea, even if they themselves are not capable of implementing it. If the DAO agrees it's a good idea, then it will be open to builders to propose themselves. Its a win if nouners are 1st voting on high level ideas, rather than specific teams/exact implementations. 
- A larger pool of builders will be attracted to prop lot as the ""ideas marketplace"". Need an idea for something to build in the nouns ecosystem? Come check prop lot! 
- People with ideas should be compensated in some way for their ideas.
- There should be a fluid process going from an idea -> proposal on chain rather than having to find delegates, which can be intimidating for some users.

There's no central place for proposal owners to update the DAO and we don't suggest that they do. 1) There needs to be a tool for easy communication between funded proposers and DAO members and 2) the DAO needs to suggest that proposers update if they are funded.

Here is my response from Twitter as well

> I think the DAO should suggest that builders give updates if they are funded. This is not an unreasonable request. This suggestion could be made during the proposal flow. Not a definitive rule, but a suggestion that conveys the message ""We have this tool and you should use it because we love updates and enjoy seeing your progress"". I'm not aware of any suggestions of how a proposal owner might update the DAO, or actions they should take after they are funded. 

> Without a central discord, Noun communication is fragmented. How does a proposal owner know where to post updates?

2. person does some work, decides to pay themselves
3. person submits updates, which ""unlocks"" ability to pay themselves

There wouldn't need to be any sort of approval mechanism. Of course that could be added, but even having something where you are encouraged to submit a note about why you are paying yourself with updates along the way could be interesting, and would maybe provide the incentive layer. 

Then, if people were interested, there could be a lightweight UI that aggregates these updates with the payment receipts so there is a central place to viewing payment requests as a response to completing work.

Just a thought.","There is currently no specific system in place for incentivizing people to submit updates.

**NFJ FAQs:**
**1. The Exhibition And The Auction**
**Why is there a need for an exhibition?**
The exhibition is an important part of making the whole project Nounish. We see fine jewellery as a means to kickstart the Nouns conversation, whether it‚Äôs with someone wearing the Nounish jewellery or with someone attending the exhibition.

This is also why we chose to coincide the exhibition with Token2049 and F1 Singapore ‚Äì it‚Äôs the best opportunity to bring attention to the Nounish displays and to tell the Nouns story, while also driving awareness and demand for the subsequent auction. International visitors who are either interested in Web3 or simply visiting for the F1 weekend, who can be exposed to Nouns ‚Äì while these audiences may not be the final owners of the fine jewellery, they are all audiences who will learn about Nouns and talk about Nouns. The exhibition will be at the State Property Atelier at 36 Armenian Street. This is a ground-floor corner unit with a wide window showcase, located in Singapore‚Äôs civic district, so the exhibition and Nounish displays will be very visible even from the outside.

**What happens if no one bids for a particular Jewellery NFT during the auction?**
Any unsold NFTs will be minted to State Property‚Äôs cold wallet while the physical jewellery will be kept in the custody of State Property. State Property will sell the jewellery (and NFT) outside of the auction period with their retail arm, and sales proceeds will be converted to ETH and sent to NounsDAO upon closing of each sale.
This is to ensure that the project hits its goal of returning value to the DAO, even if some of the auctions may not be successful.","The exhibition is an important part of making the whole project Nounish, as it aims to kickstart the Nouns conversation through fine jewelry.

This proposal is a proof-of-concept of decentralised brand building - can Nouns as a brand expand into multiple sectors by funding creative experiments? What will these individual sectors e.g. fashion, jewellery, consumer products, bring for NounsDAO collectively? We also want to demonstrate the applicability of NFTs in the luxury jewellery sector, and this is just the first step to introducing the traditional luxury audience to NFTs.

**3. State Property And Their Design**
**Tell us more about this project! How did it all come together?**
The NFJ project can be best described as a serendipitous coming together of people, place, and product.
Prior to jumping fully into NFT, Han (Beetle). His venture into the NFT space led him to meet Ben and Mai from HeyMint, and later on Karl at the beach clean-up, whom introduced the concept of Nouns and their Web3 ethos.
Since early 2022, Han has been trying to introduce the concept of NFTs to State Property‚Äôs jewellery. The idea floated around for a while and it wasn‚Äôt until Karl popped by the State Property Atelier one day to share about Nouns, when designers Rui and Afzal fell in love with the Nouns aesthetics instantly. They could immediately envision the colours, the Nouns characters, and even the Noggles in modern, luxurious jewellery! Over the next few months, the crew worked together to iterate on the designs, the drop, the target audience, and the strategic approach, which culminated in this proposal.","This proposal aims to benefit the NFT space by serving as a proof-of-concept for decentralized brand building, exploring the expansion of Nouns as a brand into multiple sectors through creative experiments. It also seeks to demonstrate the applicability of NFTs in the luxury jewelry sector, introducing the traditional luxury audience to NFTs. The project brings together NFT holders interested in fine jewelry, traditional jewelry collectors, and buyers, creating opportunities to share the Nouns story and ethos."

Your concern about demand is valid and as <@797480395880661002> shared above, it's about reaching out not only to Nouns holders, but also sharing about Nouns and NFT with our traditional fine jewellery clients.

Therein also lies our design approach, where we want to create beautiful pieces that our clients will want to wear first and foremost, while also being able to encapsulate the Nouns story. Through wearers donning the physical pieces, through the exhibition, these are what create opportunities to share what Nouns is about.

And as <@888234867316387940> asked earlier, why 9 pieces? The reason we went with a small enough number is to remain exclusive yet being manageable (to sell) and more importantly, cohesive enough to tell the Nouns story. And the reason we didn't go with a larger number is also strategic, in keeping it exclusive while opening up the possibility of a second collection should demand scales upon the exhibition and auction.",The reason for creating 9 pieces of fine jewelry is to keep the collection exclusive yet manageable to sell and cohesive enough to tell the Nouns story.

Diving further into the Nouns ethos and the community spirit of NFTs, Rui and Afzal quickly identified with the deeper meaning behind this decentralised movement and the cultural significance of memes and digital avatars. With their design philosophy of finding balance and tension, and expressing these through fine jewellery, it felt almost intuitive as they were coming up with designs that embody this countercultural movement and this absurdity.
Rui has always believed that the jewellery we wear is a great starting point for a conversation, which was also what inspired some of these designs. As such, you‚Äôll also find that the playful omission of the Noggles has also led to this conversation of, ‚ÄúWhere are the Noggles?‚Äù

**Would leaving out the Noggles make this collection less Nounish?**
We see this project as a whole ‚Äì the jazzed up exhibition space, the Nounish displays, posters, and collaterals that will all come together. We also pay homage to the daily auctions of Nouns with our auction, and as a package, these will all be very Nounish.
As such, leaving out the Noggle is a subtle design intention, meant to drive conversation and also to hint at our plans to continue building with a second Nounish collection.","The story behind the 1/1 designs is inspired by the Nouns ethos, the community spirit of NFTs, and the cultural significance of memes and digital avatars.

I'm curious about how this is going to work. How will you officially affiliate with franchises, is there anything formal happening here? ie are you going to get a trademark and protect the name ""Nouns Deli""? 

And what will you do with unofficial Nouns Delis, ie if someone creates one but doesn't go through your screening process?

CC0 franchising is fascinating and I'm really curious to see whats possible here. If we can figure out a good model it might be easily replicated with other types of businesses.","To protect the 'Nouns Deli' brand, it will be trademarked to guard against misuse. The DAO could vote on potential teams/locations for future stores to be ""Noun Official Stamped"" (think open editions). With this comes training, support, and mentoring to ensure that the brand is upheld to the same standard as HQ. Initially, the trademark will cover Australia and New Zealand. If the pilot is successful, the DAO can scale as required."

I love the idea because it's so novel, and it sounds good conceptually ‚Äì and outcome aside, I feel that it's an experiment that needs to be tried, which also makes Nouns the perfect brand for it. 

For the Jewelry prop, because of our luxury target segment, CC0 designs is not in our consideration ‚Äì yes we can extend a wider reach with CC0 but luxury goods are valuable because of their quality and exclusivity, so it's a different non-mass-market approach.

Having said that, we think of CC0 in how Nouns aesthetics can be used and given a creative spin to it, whether it's in fine jewellery, or 3D fashion, or Nounsbrand. And each of these projects will inspire more designers to come proliferate Nouns, and adding their own take to it.

The reason we opted to return the full auction proceeds to Nouns isn't so much to guarantee a profit, but rather we see it as a way to reduce the risk of experimenting. And if the experiment is successful (whether measured in final sales, bids, reach, use of Launchpad), it opens up future ways that brands can work with Nouns. So IMO, I don't think there's one better approach, but it depends on the type of industry/product?","The Nouns Deli project is not about acquiring ownership of the restaurant. The $200,000 funding is intended for brand exposure purposes and to help fund the store makeover, which will work to help proliferate the Nouns brand and trial a new model of CC0 franchises. The goal is to find ways for it to have a positive ROI to adopt Nouns branding and the Open Franchising Model, opt-in either when building originally or retrofit or to whatever extent an independent restaurant feels is appropriate."

My goal is to find ways for it to pay for restaurants to rebrand as Nounish.

My bigger picture goal for it is to extend how we even think about the Nouns brand and how it spreads. How to make this into a repeatable Open Franchise kit, with the Nouns cc0 meme, open to all, such that any independent restauranter can plug into it and use aspects of it as they see fit (or not, open means use what works or nothing at all), and each one that plugs in enhances the entire network and its reach and relevance, a decentralized cc0 branded franchise. There are other elements to this stack that can be added by smart builders if they see an opportunity from loyalty/marketing/retention/rewards program/Web3 Point of Sale UX are all natural fits and some will be made in this Proposal but this model and kit will be open and evolve and incorporate what works and drop what doesn't over time.","The goal of the Nouns Deli project is to find ways for it to pay for restaurants to rebrand as Nounish and to create a repeatable Open Franchise kit with the Nouns CC0 meme.

First thing to consider is the longevity of the deliverables and the attention the completed proposal brings to Nouns over time. As a CC0 resource The Wizard's Hat can live on forever. The ultimate success would be if this video becomes a cultural icon and is remembered and watched hundreds of years from now. It could equally as likely be forgotten and fade away, and worst case scenario, it becomes a taboo video reviled by society that makes people hate Nouns. Returning ETH to the DAO mitigates the financial risk taken, but ultimately for an org like Nouns the valuable goal is long term, high quality attention on Nouns, and the ability to convert it into NFT sales. And the biggest risk is damage to the brand.

For a prop like the jewelry one, the pieces are physical, held privately, and won't last forever. The prop's success is reliant on the press and stories generated from it. This proposal needs to directly connect to people who would buy Nouns, either through the actual events and jewelry auctions, or through the associated press that comes from the project. This isn't unreasonable given that the jewelry prop involves an auction of expensive luxury goods.

This Nouns Deli project intends to be self-sustainable after the initial funding, and it's easier to trust that knowing it was already a successful business. So you get Nouns brand proliferation for the lifetime of this business / building. Best case scenario, the location becomes a cult hit, with high quality food, good culture. Worst case, the service and food are so poor it hurts the Nouns brand. In general though, if rebranding existing businesses works, it could be a repeatable approach to proliferating Nouns.

The real longevity in this Nouns Deli idea, however, comes from the CC0 franchise aspect. If it's done right, they could create a repeatable, financially successful business model that entrepreneurs could start in other cities for free. All of this assumes they will deliver world class / memorable food and experiences that people would actually want to copy. Viral success here is probably exceedingly difficult, but its an interesting path to explore. I would also hope that businesses like this become deeply involved with Nouns culture, host events, fund their own marketing with the brand, and over time become partners in proliferating Nouns as a byproduct of marketing their own economic flywheel.

Back to your specific point - should Nouns prioritize projects that return funds to the DAO. On one hand, returning funds to the DAO could become a sustainable alternate source of revenue. Maybe it could even exceed auction sales. On the other hand, it adds a tax which directly decreases a business's odds of long term viral growth, which is what will propel our sustained auctions over time.

I would like to see proposals experiment with all of this, because operating a CC0 brand is all pretty novel territory. But phrases like this: ""After initial funding this site will be totally self-sustainable."" make me way more open to not requiring a direct financial return.

So my main decider here is - will they deliver excellence? Is this a place I would eat? Would I bring friends here? Do the sauces taste good? Can Nouns Deli become a unique staple within their local food culture?","The Nouns Deli project intends to be self-sustainable after the initial funding, and it's easier to trust that knowing it was already a successful business. The real longevity in this Nouns Deli idea comes from the CC0 franchise aspect. If it's done right, they could create a repeatable, financially successful business model that entrepreneurs could start in other cities for free. One way to loop this back to a return to the DAO would be for, if the franchise model works, to make it normative for all participants who use the Franchise kit/branding/Open Permissionless Franchise Stack/whatever the package looks like over time to set aside 2% of revenue towards buying Nouns. Then the flywheel loops back to not just meme proliferation but direct participation in the DAO itself."

3) what happens if he gets hurt during the event? 
4) where does revenue from the documentary, if it gets picked up by streamers or other distribution channels, go?

1) Nouns will be everywhere in the documentary. It'll be in 80% of the scenes - the beginning will show Wheelz discovering Nouns, we'll show fun Nounish scenes of people in Noggles voting then prop passing, everybody meaningful in the documentary (ramp maker and our marketing materials guy will be featured with Noggles, the whole mega ramp will be decked out in Nouns marketing stuff, a massive Noggles inflatable will be next to the mega ramp, his wheelchair will be Nounified and presented to him as he walks up to the mega ramp by people with Noggles on. Needless to say, I'm making sure every corner of this doc is Nounish.
2) In the spirit of underpromising and overdelivering, I didn't want to guarantee any coverage. Between Wheelz and I, we've both been covered in ESPN, Bleacher Report, CNN, Guinness Book of World Records (who also may be present at the event b/c they love Wheelz), Forbes, etc. People LOVE to cover Wheelz and what he does. I'll make sure that all of those sources will hear about the release of this documentary 2 weeks out from release.
3) Wheelz has the best insurance someone in his position can buy. The ramp and the stunt itself is safer than you think, the most dangerous part is being at the top of the 30 ft ramp. The lander is semi-hard and absorbs a lot of the landing energy (check out the America's Got Talent video he did last year to see the ramp we're using). In the event he does get hurt or injured, the remaining funds will be returned to the DAO.
4) This will be the first video on a new Youtube channel called Every Day, Forever. Don't believe we'll be able to earn ad revenue on it. However, I plan on submitting a droposal where 50% of the open edition sales will go back to NounsDAO.","1) Nouns will be heavily involved in the documentary, appearing in 80% of the scenes. The documentary will show Wheelz discovering Nouns, people in Noggles voting and props passing, and various Noun-related marketing materials.

2) While no specific coverage is guaranteed, Wheelz and the documentary creator have been covered by major media outlets in the past. They will ensure these sources hear about the documentary release two weeks before it happens.
3) Wheelz has the best insurance available for his situation. The ramp and stunt are relatively safe, but if he gets hurt or injured, the remaining funds will be returned to the DAO.

https://nouns.wtf/vote/162

For context, a few entities I have relationships with are also funding prizes at ETH Lisbon, are spending the same as we are all-in but the call to action is specifically to get people integrating with or building on them or recruiting directly and it's with a laser focus on that business development.  We don't have the same call to action so mimicking their cost structure, I am not sure that works or makes sense.  Would we better off funding our own single hackathon or hackathons than this approach?  Or at least we could do this model but focus on Devcon and maybe 1 other event rather than blanketing the schedule.  We don't have to be ubiquitous, we have to be special, compelling and persistent across time.

Open to being convinced otherwise and I value the testimonials from <@303004182129147905> and Brennen and Chris and have been a fan of Nouns Amigos.","The Nouns Fair is focused on builders and attends hackathons to engage with developers, designers, PMs, and other builders.

I would also want to know, but don't see: what is the total cost and total sponsorship required for the event. I.e. would nouns be putting in 5% or 95%? I can't tell. 

The cost of the entire event is about $25K, so that gives you an idea.

Blooomz - who activated Nounish proliferation at W3BSTOCK MIAMI and also at our Lil Nouns collab event at ETH Denver this year. 


How can more value be added to the proposal? 

This gets Nouns front and center at W3BSTOCK NYC with additional Nounish proliferation at the W3BSTOCK x Nolcha Shows x CryptoPunks party on April 12th and the W3BSTOCK x Nolcha Shows party at the SLS South Beach on May 25th for Bitcoin 2023.","The event is expected to have about 1,500 attendees.

Seems like the only differences in scope are a 20'x20' booth instead of 10'x10' and a photobooth with an NFT claim (POAP?) but the budget is 3.5 ETH higher. 

I'm also unclear on the 'ROI to the DAO' section. I think you should elaborate on *how* these things will be accomplished and why they are important. You say 'analytics' but 2 of the 6 bullets are photos, are you going to count the number of photos produced? Is that a helpful metric? Another is 'branding and proliferation' which mentions social impressions, yet the last bullet states 'aggregated brand impressions from all social media' which seems to be the same as social impressions? And for website traffic, how will you distinguish traffic generated solely from the event to the Nouns website? You also mention analytics for 7/30/90 days, again how will you attribute impacts that far after the event to the event? I think the specifics of how this will be accomplished are a relevant detail that should be included.

I had also posted a question in the Lil Nouns prop idea thread, so I'm just going to copy/paste it here, though it appears the budget breakdown has been removed from the prop so the second half isn't quite as relevant. 

`will there be other sponsors, what will their packages be priced at, and what will they receive? are the merch costs listed separate of sponsorship price? if so what is the actual cost of the sponsorship? the breakdown is confusing`","The larger ask after moving from Lil Nouns to Nouns is due to the increased scope, including a 20'x20' booth instead of a 10'x10' booth and a photobooth with an NFT claim. The budget is 3.5 ETH higher because the proposer believes that the proper amount is needed for a partnership like this. The proposer also mentioned that they had initially given Lil Nouns a cheaper ask as a favor, but after not receiving the support they expected, they decided to cancel the proposal and bring the proper ask to Nouns.

Regarding the 'ROI to the DAO' section, the proposer did not provide specific details on how the metrics for 7/30/90 days will be accomplished, stating that they will be observing how another fellow Nounish individual does so and that not everything has to be explained all the time. They assured that their years of experience will suffice in getting the job done.

As for the timing concerns, the proposer mentioned that they have local production capabilities in NYC and can work on a rushed basis if needed. They also mentioned that Nouns will be partnering with W3bstock, not just sponsoring this event, and the partnership will go much"

Yes! I have some comparable data on how much other esports teams are sponsored for and what they receive in return. Let's start with Dota as an example. Our team is currently ranked 3rd out of the 16 teams that compete in the Pro Circuit in North America, and we are proposing to pay our players up to $4000 per month.

In comparison, the two teams ranked above us in Dota are Shopify Rebellion and TSM. Shopify Rebellion players, historically one of the most dominant NA teams, are making around $20,000 per month. TSM brought in a new squad consisting of international players from regions across the world and receive between $5000 to $7000 per month.

In South America, the top two teams that we've competed against historically receive $9000 and $12,000 per month, respectively.

In the CS:GO vertical, our players are also receiving up to $4000 per month. The most dominant teams in North America are Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses. Team Liquid is one of the best teams internationally and has a long history in esports. While every player on their team likely makes six figures of salary, star players on independent contracts likely earn upwards of $20-30k per month. Generally speaking all the top teams are making six-figures of salary.

Evil Geniuses is running a unique program in CS:GO with a ""main"" roster and two training squads, ""White"" and ""Black."" Their training rosters earn $5000 per month, while their main roster likely earns double that.

In both game verticals we believe we've identified and are working with teams that fit in a sweet spot of skill, player notoriety, and cost.

So what do these esports orgs get in return?  Attention. They are brands that sell content and association with their content. In Shopify Rebellion's case, they have no additional sponsors, but in the case of teams like Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses, esports native brands, they have a sleeve full of sponsors who pay to be a part of the team's journey.","Other esports teams are sponsored for varying amounts depending on their ranking and performance. For example, in Dota, Shopify Rebellion players make around $20,000 per month, while TSM players receive between $5,000 to $7,000 per month. In the CS:GO vertical, top teams like Team Liquid have players making six-figure salaries, with star players earning upwards of $20-30k per month. Evil Geniuses' main roster likely earns double the $5,000 per month that their training rosters receive.

In return for sponsorship, esports organizations gain attention and brand recognition. They sell content and association with their content, attracting both endemic and non-endemic sponsors who pay to be part of the team's journey."

Regarding the benefits brought to Nouns from our esports endeavors with the funding already received. We have clearly established ourselves in the realm of esports, and now receive regular press about our efforts. Nouners often join for a mixture of different activities across Nouns, but I want to say that in some part we have moved the needle on the overall decision people make when they join, especially if they're a gamer, which I know we have quite a few of in the DAO at this point. Some of my favorite Nouner joins, in which I think we can clearly take credit, are Jason and Brian from Patron, who joined after and in part due to hearing about our esports efforts & Dota team. Both of them provided testimonials that we included in our last proposal, 119 https://i.imgur.com/nnp2pBk.png","The benefits brought to Nouns from the esports endeavors with the funding already received include establishing the Nouns brand in the esports realm, receiving regular press about their efforts, and attracting new members to the DAO.

I appreciate your perspective on the conversion impact of this proposal. While it's true that two people buying nouns doesn't move the needle long term, I'll point out that it DID make our first proposal contribute net ETH gain to the treasury. Additionally, I think it's true that our esports proposals have helped move the needle on more casual gaming fans committing to joining Nouns. I understand and agree with your point that we need to consider the long-term impact on the DAO, and that is exactly why I'm so supportive of this initiative.

Let's take Prop 245 as an example since it's something we both support. This proposal is the pilot of a longer ambition to make a Nouns movie and have Nouns become a prevalent publisher of quality media. It creates the opportunity for Nouns to be in front of millions of viewers, and while the net bid from Nouners who join due to the film in the first year of publication might not outpace the cost of this film, we know that the long-term impact of having a successful movie published by the DAO, spreading our art and culture, will be immense over the years.

Similarly, our esports proposal offers the opportunity to build a brand with lasting impact. Creating a lasting esports organization that aligns with Nounish values and extends our culture to a wider audience is a significant step in this direction. Esports teams can establish themselves as legacy brands, with powerful audiences that can meaningfully monetize and empower their organizations through fandom. 

Our esports proposal offers an innovative experience for gamers to participate in the decision-making of an esports org. There are no other esports teams where you can join and have a seat at the table in a transparent ecosystem, and Nouns is reimagining how the industry should operate. Less than one year in esports is a flash in the pan team, not yet worthy of the following of an esports fan who's been supporting their game for a decade+. We need to show our commitment to the community for them to truly take notice. This is how we convert this very hardcore and dedicated audience.

The way I view it, Nouns is already a team. What drives the fandom? The culture. When we extend this culture to esports, it's radically different from what most of the community has experienced, and many have found it immediately endearing. Wait until we have a Nounish video explaining how it all works to the average gamer, I expect it to be some of their most viewed content. By participating at the highest level of competition in some of the most popular games in the world, and creating a lasting brand, we can reach out to millions of gamers and create an evergreen impact.

In addition, gaming and crypto are becoming more intertwined, and this proposal is a great opportunity for Nouns to speak natively with gamers and extend our culture in an authentic way. This can help us attract new members who align with our values and expand our community.

Thank you again for your feedback, and I look forward to continuing the conversation <:nouns_def_salute:999878787057598494>","The esports proposal aims to build a lasting brand with a significant impact by creating a unique experience for gamers to participate in the decision-making of an esports organization.

If you are spending $10k on something amorphous, ok, get wild.  If you're spending $800k on brand awareness for 1 year, it should be tighter and clearer that it's impactful.

Re: partnership opportunities.  This seems like opportunities to spend money with another organization for more advertising?

Re: ""Overall, sponsoring an esports team can provide a DAO with a valuable opportunity to connect with a highly engaged and passionate community, increase brand awareness, and potentially drive adoption and usage of their products and services.""

Is this worth $Xmm/yr?  The relationship ends when we stop paying money to teams to sponsor them or we stop sponsoring events.  How do we capture the attention in a way that justifies that spend per year? What does that look like?  If our esports organization was stood up and had inflows of its own that were material, that's a different story, then an organization that is radical is being created, one that presumably would have to share in the wins of its rosters financially and continually participates in their growth and ours brand's growth and reach and reputation.  But it's clear that won't happen anytime soon and maybe can't happen and also it was alluded to that that would somehow make this cost more.  So right now, Nouns DAO pays money and the moment it stops, there's not an organization.  $800k/yr from this Prop plus the amounts spent to stand up the pod, that's a substantial amount of money relative to our inflows for something that right now stops when we stop spending.  That makes it unlike most things -- this is advertising, a lot of it, until its effectively harnessed and funneled into the DAO in ways that haven't happened yet.","Sponsoring an esports team can provide a DAO with a valuable opportunity to connect with a highly engaged and passionate community, increase brand awareness, and potentially drive adoption and usage of their products and services. By sponsoring an esports team, the DAO can reach a highly engaged and targeted audience.

However, it is important to consider the sustainability of the pod and the balance between the amount of spend and the value brought to the DAO."

**1)** 
We consider funds delegated to the Pod to still inherently belong to Nouns. We're responsible for delegation and execution of use. For our first merch drop, we're working with a streetwear-esque supplier https://mf9.store/ to provide quality merch. We regularly receive comments asking for merch, and we expect our first release to sell out quickly. We'll also have our jerseys available for sale via print on demand. As merch production funds have been converted to fiat, and we will be receiving revenue back in fiat, we plan to reinvest all revenue back into producing larger merch quantities for the foreseeable future. Inevitably, we would have no problem providing kickback to Nouns if our merch strategy is sustainable and profitable.

**2)** 
As part of our negotiations with both our CS:GO and Dota Rosters, we did not request any cut of their tournament winnings for this proposal. We made this decision for several reasons. Primarily, it allowed us to significantly reduce the overall cost of the proposal. Additionally, there is some degree of friction with bringing funds back to the DAO due to legal and tax reasons. Furthermore, we believe that taking a significant revenue share from the players is not ideal, given our transparent model. Top teams typically do not take more than 10% (if any) of tournament winnings, and this is seen more as a way to create value-alignment rather than a major revenue driver for orgs. While we would consider a small revenue share back to Nouns in future deals with teams, for our younger organization, we decided to opt out of this arrangement for the current season.

**3) ** 
I look at sustainability in a few ways in the context of the unique intermingling of Nouns and Esports...

Is our project creating bid demand for Nouns? Albeit unclear to quantify, historically, we've already done that and have been attributed for doing so (see my response to Hindsight above).

Can we achieve partnerships or create opportunities worth significant revenue? One of the tournaments we are participating in this coming month will have organization rewards up to $100,000. This is based on social and performance metrics. If our team qualifies for the next stage of the circuit, that team incentive will 3x, up to $300,000. As we continue to cement ourselves as an established brand (many top orgs are decades old while we're still within our first year), we believe partnership inflow will continue to increase. Another partnership example, which I don't want to promise is happening because it's still early, is being paid as an organization to field a roster and compete in a particular game (a very popular FPS). This would also be a six-figure deal, but likely a significant portion is expected to go directly back into investing in the team.

Sponsors? What if Nouns Esports had sponsors other than Nouns? Well, that is something we are pursuing and exploring. We've already been approached by what I would call ""low-hanging fruit"" sponsors, e.g. betting, but what we are really looking for are ideal partners that are culturally aligned with Nouns. For example, Coinbase and Uniswap both sponsor Dota teams, why shouldn't they sponsor the Nouns team? Nouns, due to the art, culture, and technological innovation from the community, is one of the best places to onboard people into crypto. I believe subcommunity efforts, like Esports and Gnars, are the future of onboarding as top-of-funnel tools for Nouns. What if we were also top of funnel onboarding for Base, Coinbase's new L2? Proof of Gamer & That's Gnarly would certainly benefit from lower friction experiences on L2, and Nouns would benefit from Nounish experiences being available on where Coinbase will be driving users.","1) Funds delegated to the Pod are considered to belong to Nouns, and revenue generated from merchandise sales will be reinvested into producing larger merch quantities for the foreseeable future.

For instance, you could only allow bidding in the last 5 minutes of the auction.

Members of DAO buy tokens-> DOA funds Projects -> in celebration members of DAO are end distribution of product at more cost. 

This seems to be the current model, and I'm not sure it sits well or is proper. 

If we are talking about WHY buy tokens well,,, answer is always utility. where have ANY token holders been provided with Utility along this path? 
Any mint price above some type of .0042-.0069 (for teh culture -> and acknowledging a JOB WELL DONE) seems to be extractionary. not only that I think the This is Nouns .. while it gathered a lot of funding wasnt successful in explaining nouns to the world. many walked away from that mint with a bad taste. (DYOR, yes... but still) 

I also understand that this is a new model . early . will tokens have use case later... etc etc .... but just some thoughts I have been thinking. wanted to get down.","The current model you mentioned involves DAO members buying tokens, funding projects, and then being part of the end distribution of the product at an additional cost. You questioned the utility provided to token holders along this path. In the case of the Gnarly EP drop, the singles are being sold at around $10 each, and if you collect all three, you get the EP for free. As for explicit utility, they function as voting tokens on `thatsgnar.ly`. The .0042-.0069 range is considered a reasonable ask when selling an OE collectible. It's important to manage expectations and avoid vague promises of utility that can cause speculation."

And I'll **assume** most of the manufacturing and production costs  are fair, given your expertise, which then comes several questions:

1. Target Audience ‚Äì¬†New to programming individuals
With the computers, am I right to say that you are targeting new, inexperienced technical coders to be onboarded to Nouns, and hopefully build for Nouns? I assume as such because of the educational component and the ""rawness"" of the computers. 

If so, could your prop include some Noun-specific programme e.g. contest/event, that can definitely deliver this outcome as opposed to hoping for that outcome? I get that the hackathon has that element, but IMO, the way you frame it sounds like mere visibility for Nouns as opposed to having a Noun-specific challenge during the hackathon.

2. ""Fruits of investments""
In your words, Phase 4 will be when NounsDAO ""harvest fruits from its investment"". Since we're approaching from an investment POV, and the first 3 phases cost $990K, a cool M, in your opinion what kind of benefits can the DAO expect?

I don't think you're referring to computers as the ""fruits"", because that will be just the DAO paying for the development of the computer. IMO, the prop feels like a lot of ""this can happen"", so I'd love to hear your thoughts on how this benefits the DAO.

3. Where does the revenue from the computer sales go?
In Phase 4, $450K is used to manufacture 3k-5k computers, 400+400+30% is accounted for. Let's assume the lower quantity of 3K is manufactured, that leaves another 1,500 computers ready to be sold (or used somewhere).

Would love to see how the revenue will go e.g. offset the DAO's investment, or possibly use that to fund the patent/trademark application (which is another question on whether it's needed) or the booth at CES.","1. The target audiences for the Noun-Computers include:
   i) devs at ETH hackathons - Noun-Computers will be provided for competitions, with plans to run Noun-specific competitions.
   ii) attendees at ETH hackathons - Noun-Computers can be used to run ETH nodes or prototype new products/services with various modules.
   iii) students at schools and universities - Noun-Computers can be used for general blockchain development education and Noun-specific applications.

Also only first $200K will be transferred to me and rest of 82% money will be in safe and used only after confirmation of prototype. I invite everyone to participate in the judging the outcome of the prototype stage. I would love to add you to the multi-sig as well.

Also, I see nouns as a community of talented people and know many would volunteer to advice if something unsolvable would happened.","It is possible to support a project that requests smaller funding at the beginning for prototyping and then requires additional funding for completion and manufacturing. The first $200K will be transferred to the proposer, and the rest of the funds will be in a safe and used only after confirmation of the prototype. The proposer invites everyone to participate in judging the outcome of the prototype stage and is open to adding people to the multi-sig. The project aims to generate visibility across many ETH hackathons and fund ideas that can create a constant presence for Nouns in various locations."

This would allow for the following benefits:

1. Getting the same performance computers at below $60.
2. Giving away more computers if you consider $1mm in Raspberry Pi's vs Noun-Computers.
3. Selling some of the computers to make profits and fund itself.

This approach would be more scalable and sustainable compared to leveraging similar existing boards like Raspberry Pi's. Additionally, better aesthetics and features like hot swappable SSD and CMOS Battery could attract people to buy Noun-Computer instead of other available options."

Production timeline and pricing wise is reasonable too (IMO), which leads me to the following questions:

*1. How do you see this prop, in relation to Nounsbrand? https://twitter.com/nounsbrand*
I don't think it's competition, but considering that future clothing projects can likewise keep emerging. Shouldn't the previous-funded ones shed light in terms of demand?

Also, only because you wrote ""the final designs are a perfect blend of art, fashion, and what's considered nounish"", my personal opinion (subjective I know) is that Nouns brand has a more artful take compared to your proposed designs, which are merely printing Nouns traits onto coloured clothing.

*2. I'm trying to understand the role of LeBlanc Studios*
Are they a design partner? Manufacturing partner? Is wears.wtf a joint venture or subsidiary of Le Blanc?

Further, you mentioned that ""We are in contact with reputable manufacturers to ensure ethically made clothing, and that the final products are not only stylish and comfortable but also durable."" But also, it appears that you guys are tapping onto Le Blanc ""who is also providing already established partnerships with manufacturers in the following countries"".

If so, why are you not tapping onto their manufacturing partners and having to source for your own?

Just to be clear, I think multiple Noun clothing brands and experiments can co-exist. I'm curious about the differentiator here, which is smth future props should consider too.

*3. In your vision, how will wears.wtf be self-sustainable after the two phases? *
Having the small-scale start and scaling up is good. Can you briefly explain what are the success factors that can possibly lead to sustainability of the brand in future? Thank you!","1. This proposal is not in direct competition with Nounsbrand, as multiple Noun clothing brands and experiments can co-exist. The demand for previous-funded projects can help shed light on the demand for future projects.

2. LeBlanc Studios is a design partner for wears.wtf. The role of LeBlanc Studios in the project is not entirely clear, but it seems they have established partnerships with manufacturers in various countries. The reason for not tapping into their manufacturing partners and sourcing for their own is not provided in the conversation.

3. The conversation does not provide information on how wears.wtf will be self-sustainable after the two phases or the success factors that can lead to the sustainability of the brand in the future."

I get what you're trying to do in terms of:
1. Let's make some clothes
2. Make it professional with lookbook shots etc
3. Sell, and then scale

I do think $75K is a reasonable ask for an experiment (complete with media content for the DAO and tapping onto POTENTIAL demand from the community). $28K goes into inventory too, so that sounds alright? Here's my humble suggestion, feel free to comment or ignore it:

‚Äì With the $28K of inventory, project how much revenue you will make if it sells out e.g. $100K
‚Äì Phase 2 scaling up is contingent on proving demand/sell-out of Phase 1 anyway. So you need to sell out and show demand, if not you won't get further funding
‚Äì If you do sell out then, and show e.g. $75K proposal generate $100K in revenue, I think it'll be an easier ask from the DAO to fund any further prop, contingent on how the further ask can benefit the DAO further 
‚Äì Well, if you can show that demand, I'm pretty sure you can get funds from elsewhere even if not from NounsDAO. Or if you already see that demand, I'm sure you'll be willing to fund it yourself to get the full ROI.","To achieve substantial demand for wears.wtf products, the primary focus will be on creating a high-quality product that is comfortable, durable, and captures the essence of nounishness in the context the clothing is meant to be worn.

> 1. How do you see this prop, in relation to Nounsbrand?

i believe that as nouns continues to grow, we can expect to see similar concepts and goals emerging. this is actually a positive development, imo, as it can provide valuable insights into what works best and how to achieve the desired outcomes. each project has a distinct focus, with nouns brand being a fusion of streetwear and high-fashion, while wears.wtf is more focused on ready-to-wear clothing.

it is essential to recognize that the demand for high-fashion/streetwear cannot be directly transferred to an estimation of demand for ready-to-wear clothing. each project appeals to a different audience and serves a unique purpose. as for the artistic aspect, wears.wtf is currently centered on nounssentials, which are day-to-day garments designed to be easily integrated into one's wardrobe.

in summary, nouns brand can be seen as high-fashion/streetwear, wears.wtf as ready-to-wear clothing, and merch as print-on-demand with basic quality. each project has its own niche and target audience.

> 2. I'm trying to understand the role of LeBlanc Studios. Are they a design partner? Manufacturing partner? Is wears.wtf a joint venture or subsidiary of Le Blanc?

wears.wtf is a joint venture, aimed at bringing the brand to market and achieving self-sustainability more efficiently than if starting from scratch. while most fabrics and materials will be sourced from leblanc's manufacturers, a minority will not. 

once self-sustainable, wears.wtf will have its own distinct team, suppliers, and manufacturers. starting now, leblanc will provide a dedicated team for wears.wtf, which will likely remain with the brand as it continues to evolve and develop. this approach allows wears.wtf to establish itself independently while still benefiting from leblanc's expertise and resources.

> 3. In your vision, how will wears.wtf be self-sustainable after the two phases?

wears.wtf will become self-sustainable after the completion of the two phases because our approach is designed to focus on essential tasks and avoid wasting time or resources. by the end of the second phase, we anticipate having a strong brand identity, high-quality products and designs, and significant demand. this will enable us to continue growing the brand in a self-sustainable manner, using profits from collections to further scale and expand the business.

additionally, working on other CC0 project's collections will also allow wears.wtf to smoothly expand into the web3 ecosystem, further contributing to its success factors.

to summarize, the success factors leading to the self-sustainability of wears.wtf include: substantial demand for our products, high customer satisfaction, effective marketing and promotion, ethical and sustainable practices, adapting to market trends, efficient supply management, a strong team, and seamless integration with the web3 ecosystem through collections with CC0 projects.

We love Nouns and are interested in DAOs and making Ops in DAOs more efficient, it's a huge pain point, and we thought nuanced escrow services could help with this pain point. We thought this could be a win-win for the community, allowing DAOs to retrieve money if props go to shit or allowing people to build trust with a long-term vision for their prop. After deploying nouns and hopefully achieving public infra PMF, we will work on other private escrow services that won't affect nouns or nearby communities. 

We requested 16ETH to cover the audit cost. We didn't ask for enough ETH to cover the whole project, so transferring ownership to nouns seems like a bit much unless we received funding for the entire project.  

As for the risk of us being potentially malicious, I have met nouns40, Chris, and other nouners in Denver; I posted my picture on Twitter when I bought my noun. I live in the bay area with two kids. I'm easy to find. I'm not going to steal 200k prop money so that I can go to jail. So hopefully, we can put the malicious argument to rest. If nouns want to incentivize great builders to build great things, they need their independence and support. And builders need to verify that they aren't going to be malicious. I will happily dox myself to 3 nouners in the community. 

We have a gnosis-safe setup to receive tip (optional) fees if the recipient decides. We are a public infra with many costs (subgraph, Cloudflare, 3k deployment fees to main net, audits, designer, etc.), and to be sustainable and support those costs, we have tips added to our public infra. We doubt we are going to get rich off of tips. And we have plans to add other escrow contracts with dynamic arbiters/tips in the future.

We believe that iterating quickly in the beginning with the nouns stream is essential to reaching PMF. We will listen to the community and adjust the escrow contracts to suit nouns and various props.",The purpose of creating the Nouns Stream Proposal Payments Infrastructure is to make operations in DAOs more efficient by providing nuanced escrow services that help with pain points in the community. The team believes that iterating quickly in the beginning with the Nouns Stream is essential to reaching product-market fit and will listen to the community and adjust the escrow contracts to suit Nouns and various proposals. The project has a Gnosis Safe setup to receive optional tip fees to support the costs of public infrastructure.

And I'll **assume** most of the manufacturing and production costs  are fair, given your expertise, which then comes several questions:

1. Target Audience ‚Äì¬†New to programming individuals
With the computers, am I right to say that you are targeting new, inexperienced technical coders to be onboarded to Nouns, and hopefully build for Nouns? I assume as such because of the educational component and the ""rawness"" of the computers. 

If so, could your prop include some Noun-specific programme e.g. contest/event, that can definitely deliver this outcome as opposed to hoping for that outcome? I get that the hackathon has that element, but IMO, the way you frame it sounds like mere visibility for Nouns as opposed to having a Noun-specific challenge during the hackathon.

2. ""Fruits of investments""
In your words, Phase 4 will be when NounsDAO ""harvest fruits from its investment"". Since we're approaching from an investment POV, and the first 3 phases cost $990K, a cool M, in your opinion what kind of benefits can the DAO expect?

I don't think you're referring to computers as the ""fruits"", because that will be just the DAO paying for the development of the computer. IMO, the prop feels like a lot of ""this can happen"", so I'd love to hear your thoughts on how this benefits the DAO.

3. Where does the revenue from the computer sales go?
In Phase 4, $450K is used to manufacture 3k-5k computers, 400+400+30% is accounted for. Let's assume the lower quantity of 3K is manufactured, that leaves another 1,500 computers ready to be sold (or used somewhere).

Would love to see how the revenue will go e.g. offset the DAO's investment, or possibly use that to fund the patent/trademark application (which is another question on whether it's needed) or the booth at CES.","1. The target audiences for the Noun-Computers include:
   i) devs at ETH hackathons - Noun-Computers will be provided for competitions, with plans to run Noun-specific competitions.
   ii) attendees at ETH hackathons - Noun-Computers can be used to run ETH nodes or prototype new products/services with various modules.
   iii) students at schools and universities - Noun-Computers can be used for general blockchain development education and Noun-specific applications.

2. The benefits for the DAO from this investment include increased visibility, onboarding more people to Ethereum development, and potentially creating a community around Nouns and Noun-Computers.

3. The revenue from the computer sales is not explicitly mentioned in the provided conversation."

I cann't afford to buy 5 matching spinnakers for sailboats in korea, same for NY project. But with nouns, I proliferate nouns with my passion for sailing and I get a chance to work with sail makers, yacht clubs, illustrators, t-shirt manufacturesrs, and pins.

Also only first $200K will be transferred to me and rest of 82% money will be in safe and used only after confirmation of prototype. I invite everyone to participate in the judging the outcome of the prototype stage. I would love to add you to the multi-sig as well.

While $1.1m is a big money it will generate visibility across many ETH hackathons. IMO, it is best to fund ideas that can generate constant presence for nouns in many locations.

Also, I see nouns as a community of talented people and know many would volunteer to advice if something unsolvable would happened.","It is possible to support a project that requests smaller funding at the beginning for prototyping and then requires additional funding for completion and manufacturing.

This would allow for the following benefits:

1. Getting the same performance computers at below $60.
2. Giving away more computers if you consider $1mm in Raspberry Pi's vs Noun-Computers.
3. Selling some of the computers to make profits and fund itself.

This approach would be more scalable and sustainable compared to leveraging similar existing boards like Raspberry Pi's. Additionally, better aesthetics and features like hot swappable SSD and CMOS Battery could attract people to buy Noun-Computer instead of other available options."

1) Do you already have a list of artist that are going to be there, do you plan to contact them ahead of time? It's rather ambitious to think 100 artists can be secured over a 3 day period at such a busy event (my personal opinion having been to a comic-con before) 
2) The timeline is rather tight.... ideally it would be nice to have a 30 day marketing campaign planned ahead of the event where you could be posting and showing off the Noun Activity Books, connecting with attendees etc....if the prop passes you have exactly 34 days until the event - after time to produce the marketing materials it doesn't leave much time to promote ahead of the event
3) Are badges to the event already secured? Because from what I know the event is sold out .... and if badges are already secured that means you guys would already be going to the event so travel would already be accounted for - not sure why an additional $12,500 is needed. 
4) Onboarding new artists is great, but we are unaware if they would be comfortable with their art being CC0 or not.... also are we expecting them to create the art in the Nouns activity books we are providing? Are we commissioning physical art pieces or digital art? If physical where are they going to go? Is there a collab with a gallery somewhere that will display them - or do they get shipped to a warehouse somewhere & stored (bit dramatic but hopefully you get my point) 
5)  Isn't there already going to be a booth presence there for the Nouns Comics? If so, why cant this onboarding effort be done in tandem vs needing additional funding for it upfront .... could have a prop created after when X amount of artists are secured for X amount of funding.... would hate to have to turn down a dope artist because they want $500 for a sketch - so more funding might be needed than original 30K","1) The plan is to start with the ""Artists alley"" at Comic-Con, where comic artists do commission pieces for money. There is a list of artists available online, and the goal is to secure around 100 artists during the event. Four people would be working on this, with individual books per artist.
2) The main goal is to onboard artists, not the average attendee, so there isn't a need for a marketing campaign ahead of the event. The onboarding process would be more organic by being there and talking to the artists.
3) Badges are secured for some team members, and others can be secured through Titan. If the proposal passes, additional team members would need to be flown out, accommodated, and compensated for their time. Badges and hotel rooms are not cheap during the event, but access to facilities is available through partners.
4) The plan is to commission physical pieces of art that would then be scanned. Artists would be asked if they are okay with their work being CC0. Many artists don't mind, as they are looking for a paycheck. For those who don't agree, their artwork would be shared without the CC0 label. The physical objects would be stored until a decision is made"

‚ÄúMany don‚Äôt care‚Äù?
Are you nuts?
Artists and artists rights is one of the biggest pieces of meta in a comics artist‚Äôs life‚Äîexplaining CC0 to them in a venue like a con is ok‚Äîbut collecting their work and expecting them to sign off and truly understand is bonkers.
Not sure the last time anyone has gone to AA at SDCC but the last few years I have been it has been a ghost town as many of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù artists are not there.
Is their a list of which ‚Äúbest‚Äù artists are being targeted? Many of the best artists are in different sections‚Äîwether it‚Äôs the Gaijin crew or naked fat girl party, etc. many of them ‚Äúbest‚Äùalso have their commission lists filled months ‚Äînow quick black and white head sketches from ‚Äúbest‚Äù may luck out at $300 but may seem pretty insulting to these bests. Any artist that is given a book is 90% likely to toss it out as they don‚Äôt like carrying anything other than what they are looking for. I brought up before not a fan of the ashcan idea‚Äîlet‚Äôs get the comics out‚Äîlots of publishers(especially if you have a good relationship with them) will let you take books to your table. Ashcans feel cheap and have negative baggage with some from an era of get rich quick on speculation and ashcans were a part of that equation. With everything happening at SDCC and the competition for attention being noun üíä is just not going to happen‚Äîthat work will happen outside of the con and 1 on 1 conversions can be made much more efficiently and effectively targeting specific individuals and giving them the time and attention to invite to engage. Just my 2 cents. From the perspective of an artist. Most of those artists are on Facebook of all places and are typically happy to engage, I am always happy to facilitate any introductions that may be needed.","The goal of the proposal is to connect artists and Nouns, get them to create art, and organically have a conversation about Nouns, CC0, etc. The Nouns activity book would be given to artists to draw in (with a commission drawn in and paid for). If the artists grant their approval, the artwork would be scanned and placed online. If the artist does not wish for that to happen, their artwork can be shared without having the CC0 label applied to it. The physical objects would exist in storage until a decision is made on what to do with them. There are regular discussions regarding a central location for Nouns artwork, and the created art would likely go there once it has been decided upon."

Our group of writers (members from teams 1 and 2) will be available to speak at the event, and we would love to bring other writers from Prop 70 on stage.

Ultimately, it's a chance for Nouns/NounsDAO to really establish itself at the center of this movement towards decentralized storytelling.

1. They agree with the idea of having summary reports and sharable press release links with pictures of completed projects. They are working on improving the display and distribution of information related to funded projects.

2. The success stories can be found in the provided Notion link: https://www.notion.so/noun22/Nouns-DAO-Small-Grants-ac22114a6c004bafa500e2d824e32dc3. Some funded projects include jingles, nouns athletes, functional glasses, newsletters, luxury glasses, video games, and FOMO Nouns.

3. Many of the projects are still in progress, so it's too early to call any of them a failure at this stage.

4. They do not want to institute rigid guidelines that will limit flexibility. However, they are working on making it easier for people to apply and understand the program.

The challenge lies in deciding which projects to include in the marketplace. One suggestion is to have a simple rule, such as requiring each project to feature at least one Nouns attribute, making the process more objective and potentially automatable. The idea is to create a Nouns-specific marketplace to drive value into the derivatives ecosystem, incentivizing the expansion of the Nouns universe and increasing the value created within it. However, there is a concern about the DAO explicitly promoting or supporting certain derivatives over others, as it could be seen as unfair and dilutive to the value of the original Nouns."

Nouns is the official genesis of all this, on the blockchain, forever. Even if people make ""Nouns v2"" and fork the DAO and art and succeed wilder than Nouns... it's adding to Nouns. Every time Nouns v2 is mentioned in a news article... Nouns is mentioned by default. Attention goes to Nouns, NFT prices go up. It's cementing them in history. In my mind the worst thing that could happen to Nouns is people forget about it. It loses attention, loses buzz, creators stop building and move to other projects and everything slowly fades away.

Of course I could be wrong about all of this, I'm really just guessing because it's so new. It's a magical world out here and a fun place to be. Happy to be hear having this conversation with errbody!

But TLDR for now: Gnars consumes about same gas per auction as Nouns but generally sell for 1/1000th of the price atm. Back to back auctions mean about 8 per day max. 

When gas prices are high this can be quite a lot for a single entity to fund (once precedent is set probably no going back). So for now the emission rate is a product of demand and considering how early we are (less than 2 months) it‚Äôs going pretty well (yet to promote much also). 

At the moment, probably constitutes a UX problem more than an economics problem, so thanks again for the feedback. Since many of these parameters can be changed, i will explore options and as a community we can decide. 

Despite being gnarly, we can take our time and feel it out, make data driven decisions etc. Will be good fun. I think for now, directing newcomers who are met with an unsettled auction to our discord, so we can answer questions is probably a good start. üôè",

How do subDAO members discuss and stay informed? Regular summaries and more reps.

How do subDAO members propose and vote? Through the subDAO.

---

**Discussion**

IMO the discussion is important to the governance process. How do we get the best out of the Noun owners' discussion and subDAO members' discussion?

Some ideas:

More reps in Noun owners' chat: more voices proportional to the number of Nouns a subDAO has. Pro: gets more people from a subDAO involved, and allows them to share their expertise. Con: may force scaling issues on conversations sooner, as there will be more Nouns in the chat.

Some tool that provides a quick way to summarize important conversations. This helps keep more ""casual"" members informed. The low tech version of this is a human writing a daily digest of the list of topics. I'm sure there's a smarter way to do it. If we don't have enough volunteers to do this, I think it may be worth considering hiring someone to do this.

**Proposals**

The current approach is accessible enough. If a proposal is good, many Nouns would sponsor it. It's hard to make it more accessible while keeping nonsense proposals out.

**Votes**

The current approach is accessible enough. NounsDAO doesn't know what each subDAO members' commitment is to the subDAO nouns. So, it will have a hard time deciding how to weigh their votes. SubDAOs can handle this, since they do know.

Within the subDAO, I know 4 possible approaches:

- direct voting (within subDAO)
- self-selected committee
- elected committee
- representative

I prefer this approach, assuming we can keep enough voting interest:

- relevant committee does due diligence on an upcoming vote and provides recommendation
- interested members can also weigh in on the discussion
- a direct vote happens on each NounsDAO proposal","The question asked was: How do subDAO members discuss and stay informed? How do subDAO members propose and vote?

Based on the conversation, subDAO members discuss and stay informed through regular summaries, more representatives, and tools that provide quick ways to summarize important conversations. They propose and vote through the subDAO itself. Within the subDAO, there are four possible approaches for voting: direct voting, self-selected committee, elected committee, and representative. The preferred approach is for the relevant committee to do due diligence on an upcoming vote, provide a recommendation, and have interested members weigh in on the discussion.

For proposing to NounsDAO, members can either create their own proposals or the SubDAO can create a proposal based on internal consensus. In the case of SharkDAO, they use snapshot for internal voting, and signers who control the multisig are trusted to carry out the votes decided by the internal snapshot."

I think there‚Äôs a strategic decision to be made by NounsDAO with regard to treasury management:

A. ETH-only 
B. staked ETH - a low-risk, conservative and passive strategy
C. DeFi yield generation - actively managed yield generation 

I would argue in favour of A or B given the early stage NounsDAO is at. This could be a decision that we take for the next 365 days and revisit it annually. 

Let me explain the reasoning. As much as I love yield generation, and hate to see the treasury ETH ‚Äújust sitting there‚Äù I think we should be mindful about where we direct our attention and efforts. 

What we should consciously avoid at this stage is ‚Äúincrementalism‚Äù in our thinking and this is exactly where strategy C will lead us. Should we get 5% more here or there? Is that farm 20% safer or riskier? Every new person joining will have their own theory about yield generation. None of them will materially move the needle. 

By deciding that for the next 365 days we decide *NOT* to have any yield generation discussions (outside of staking ETH) we focus ourselves on core 10x innovations NounsDAO is uniquely positioned to introduce. Yield management is not one of them. 

Just a quick pulse check on what other think of it. Which strategy should we focus on for the next 365 days?","Based on the conversation, the question about which treasury management strategy NounsDAO should focus on for the next 365 days was not directly answered. However, there were opinions shared in favor of staking ETH (option B) and some discussions about other potential investments like BTC, NFTs, and ERC-20 tokens. It is suggested that a small and elite committee could be formed to make recommendations on financial strategies for the organization."

Most noun owners know how to grow wealth, that is how they got to afford a noun. Most noun owners could certainly be (and probably are) putting their personal treasuries to work via yield earning. 

What is the appeal of nounsdao? What is the UVP of being a member and investing capital here as opposed to elsewhere?

I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs that you can pool your ETH together to participate in the same yield generation activities that you already can on your own‚Ä¶ The opportunity here is the model created where the feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns, driving value to the NFTs, bootstrapping community and all the good stuff that spending the ETH in novel and experimental ways can bring.

Is attention/focus/time the scarcest commodity in crypto? And are some of nouns greatest assets the brains, experience, and connections of the nouners themselves? 

My fear is that every minute nouners spend thinking and debating traditional treasury management measures like yield generation is time not spent engaging in the unique opportunity this project presents us, and therefore kind of‚Ä¶ a waste. Could be done elsewhere, way more efficiently, where attention is not so split and votes aren‚Äôt required and it doesn‚Äôt have to be balanced out with the greater vision which is facing a different direction.","The appeal of NounsDAO is the unique opportunity it presents for its members to pool their resources and invest in novel and experimental ways that drive value to the NFTs, bootstrap community, and create a feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns. The focus should be on the cultural capital and clout of the organization, rather than traditional treasury management measures like yield generation. The project aims to create one of the most sought-after memberships, status symbols, and cultural artifacts in the world by using the treasury to increase demand."

decisions we expect will require more deliberation:

2. the amount of the baseline position the DAO will hold, denominated in USD (the baseline amount helps pay builders immediately, vs asking builders to wait until we can buy USD on chain)
2.1 with this decision the DAO can set lower and upper bounds within which an admin multisig can adjust things without going through the proposal process

---

decisions we expect should be easier to decide on:

1. the max price slippage rate; this should be easy as the DAO can set a reasonable upper bound and let the admin multisig find an optimal value gradually on mainnet
2. who should be the admin; personally I think the tech pod multisig is a great choice with highly relevant people already part of that team (to clarify: the highest owner role is of course the DAO's; the admin has more limited configuration rights)

P.S. some lower-priority questions we wanted to listen to your thoughts on:
* isDataURIEnabled: noticed it was removed in your branch, but we thought it could be nice to keep
* NFTDescriptor: could it make sense to convert it into a contract? we find it generally more convenient to work with contracts, and not sure of the reasons it's a library atm
* Inflate: it's currently a private library; curious for your thoughts on whether it should become a public library or a contract?
* `ISVGRenderer.Part.palette` is a pointer to an SSTORE contract: we were thinking to experiment with it being `bytes` similar to the `image` part, but thought maybe you explored that and had reasons to keep it as a pointer, like gas savings? the benefit of such a change is mostly a design consideration, i.e. making SVGRenderer unaware of storage sources, thus not imposing such a constraint on its users","The question was about feedback on the proposed implementation and some lower-priority questions. The direct replies from solimander#7468 provide feedback on the implementation and address the lower-priority questions. Here's a summary of the answers:

1. Regarding trait retirement, it's better to leave it out of the implementation until there's consensus on how traits should be selected for retirement.
2. isDataURIEnabled can be added back in for the sake of forkers.
3. NFTDescriptor can be converted into a contract if preferred, as there's no strong reason for it to be a library.
4. For Inflate, it's worth looking into gas implications before deciding whether to make it a public library or a contract.
5. Changing ISVGRenderer.Part.palette from a pointer to bytes could be a reasonable solution, and it's worth looking into.

Additionally, there are some discussions about issues with the frontend and subgraph, but they are not directly related to the original question."

If builders receive IOU tokens instead, they can easily redeem them for stablecoins by clicking the ""redeem"" button. The DAO can choose a buffer size and continually re-supply it. If a builder needs more funds sooner than the DAO can swap, the mev/arb bots will work to swap the rest.

why is this a problem?
reason 1 (reliable appearance): nouners may be planning some branding, generating some memes, paying designers, making stickers, etc - it's annoying to have to account for the re-design some of these features
reason 2 (kind of precedent): same as above, but now nouners know that their noun can change (and change is unclear here, will we change colors? content? taco ingredients?), and when there is change people are less like to build on top of things that aren't reliable

potential ways forward
1) philosophy 1: accept anything can change
2) philosophy 2: accept anything can change, but only from now onwards (legacy nouns will still look the same)
3) philosophy 3: vote against proposals that change nouns, since it make it difficult for others to realy on these appearances and we don;t want to set a bad precedent

I removed this as it was only put in place because we were unsure if OS would support dataURIs in time for the initial Nouns launch. Thinking keep it as a fallback in case dataURIs stop working or the Nouns on-chain data otherwise breaks?

> * NFTDescriptor: could it make sense to convert it into a contract? we find it generally more convenient to work with contracts, and not sure of the reasons it's a library atm

Thought other contracts may want to re-use and didn't really need any of the features of a full contract. Don't feel too strongly either way

> * Inflate: it's currently a private library; curious for your thoughts on whether it should become a public library or a contract?

Curious how much gas the passing of calldata between the contracts would add. if negligible, then I think that'd make sense.

> * ISVGRenderer.Part.palette is a pointer to an SSTORE contract: we were thinking to experiment with it being bytes similar to the image part, but thought maybe you explored that and had reasons to keep it as a pointer, like gas savings? the benefit of such a change is mostly a design consideration, i.e. making SVGRenderer unaware of storage sources, thus not imposing such a constraint on its users

Clarifying qs:

1. Do you see it as there's a param somewhere in the code that's like `V2_DAO_START_BLOCK` (set when we deploy v2 I guess) and the UI uses v2 for anything after that block and v1 for anything before? Trying to nail down exactly what you mean by ""have it support both V1 and V2""

2.  Is the current state of DQ visualizer good to go or will changes need to be made?

What sort of timeline are you all hoping to move on for this?","The question about supporting both V1 and V2 was answered by elad#6192, who suggested reading the DAO proxy's implementation address to see if it changed.

I think we agree that builder UX is important, and pegging payment to USD is already a huge improvement.

In practice the suggested solution can be such that most all props are paid directly in USD, as a function of how large the DAO decides the ‚ÄúUSD buffer‚Äù should be (aka the DAO‚Äôs USD position).

In addition, even if builders find themselves receiving IOU tokens, their challenge is quite minimal since what they have received is USD-pegged and gets redeemed by clicking on the ‚Äúredeem‚Äù button.

Btw your feedback did get us thinking: perhaps we should let anyone call redeem for anyone else with IOU balance; this way anyone in the community can help them out by converting their IOUs into stablecoins.

re: having a ‚Äúswap pod‚Äù, I think the DAO benefits from having these swaps execute trustlessly; it should lead to more predictable outcomes, without this task having to fight for anyone‚Äôs attention (Nouner attention seems like a scarce resource we should not use lightly). In addition, a trustless solution lends itself more as a public good for other DAOs to use, and that seems Nounish.

I suspect a point where we might disagree most is on the cost of builders not getting paid immediately. 

- I am confident we can configure this contract to serve us well, even if it means increasing the premium bots get to trade with us
- Even if there will be a delay, we‚Äôll likely still pay partially thanks to the USD buffer, and I believe in most cases a short delay won‚Äôt pose a material problem for builders",

another (not fully developed) idea that pops into my head is being able to set the created Noun as your ENS profile avatar.. that would entail wallet integration so might be out of scope. or maybe even direct twitter profile setting? not sure if that exists. basically, the least amount of friction to get users to use their creations as PFPs.

We will Nounify anything that can be Nounify-able. What a better way to proliferate Nounish... Donations + helping people who need help the most while proliferating Nounish. This will cause a lot of curiosity here in the country, helping us expand the sentiment and this world to others. Read the proposal for a more thorough explanation of how all of this will work. Nouns and Lil Nouns will be included in all of our marketing/pictures/videos/edits made from this pilot! Feel free to reach out if any questions arise!",

Let me give you a hint here on proposal 1183 which we have put for vote in the Nouns Mandates round 2 on governance.

https://prop.house/proposal/1183

Titel: Nouns Review House
rl;dr: Streamline the Prop House proposal & evaluation process +++ self-financing +++ on-chain +++ forever

The solution is to simplify and decrease the work to done for the nouns wrt the evaluation and voting of thousands of Prop.House proposals. 
From the conceptional work our final goal is to build a Nouns Review House DAO which streamlines the proposal and evaluation process. Reviewers will for example be rewarded or punished depending on the final voting results. Also the Nouns Review House will be self-financed by e.g. a percentage of the grant.

I see some synergies with other proposals in this round. So perhaps the nouns will vote for meaningful package.

What do you think?
Is the solution we are thinking about addressing a real problem.

Cheers from Munich!

**Coordinape**
https://app.coordinape.com/circles/3373/history

This project was intended as an experiment, providing a collective decision on how to retroactively allocate ETH to Nounish contributors for their work in Nouns. We asked the question and left the answer to the community. Would people allocate it all to the top achievers? Spread it evenly through the community? Would bad actors try to scheme ways to play the system?

We chose a commonly used DAO tool (Coordinape) and hoped to see where it shines, where it falls short, observing the emergent behaviour. We could then take that knowledge and produce some recommendations for the future. I have attached the final ETH values below, and will be doing my own analysis of lessons learned on this one. I will post them here, and publicly, as a final wrap-up of this project. Everyone else is welcome to post your own lessons and analyses.

On a very simple level this is a list of Nounish contributors who are **here**, present, spending their attention on Nouns, building in public, creating our culture, collectively steering the Nounish ship. You are the building blocks of of the Nouniverse. It's not an exhaustive list, we are missing several influential contributors, but it's a good list. It's a community.

 - Read through the contribution descriptions from the 105 nominees
 - Open the Coordinape cicle: https://app.coordinape.com/circles/3373/history
 - Allocate your 1000 GIVE tokens as you see fit
 - at the end of the EPOCH you can see how many tokens you were allocated
 - GET PAID

**WHAT BUT HOW DO I DECIDE WHO TO ALLOCATE TO**
Choose your own adventure. You could:

 - equally split tokens between all nominees
 - go through the nominee list and assign each one a token amount that seems appropriate
 - divide nominees into categories (minor, major, MVP) and allocate more tokens to people in higher categories
 - give all your tokens to a small group you thought had the most impact on Nouns
 - give all your tokens to a single person you thought had the most impact in Nouns
 - don't allocate your tokens at all and watch your Grinch-Heart shrivel up

People will be able to see how much tokens you allocated them and you can't allocate to yourself. Feel free to discuss allocation strategies here. How do we reward Nounish builders? How do we bring the best talent in, how do we build a strong community. It's an experiment!

* are we thinking the target entity that we nominate / vote for are only individuals or also proposals? (noting that proposals are often teams / groups) 
> I think it's a trade off. we might not have enough ETH for this to be meaningful rewards towards past proposals. but limiting it to non-proposals might skew the conversation towards people and not projects. that might be what we want but worth thinking about. 

* are we thinking that the people that vote are nominees only OR are we thinking non-nominees (e.g. general nouners) also vote?
> my gut is to leverage non-nominees too but maybe it's hard to get enough participation? also if it's weighted by number of nouns owned, then we might end up with nounders + a few whales by and large deciding the outcome. 

* is self-nomination allowed?
> I think we should and no reason to shame/limit against imo.

* are nominees allowed / encouraged to campaign? is there going to be some forum for them to write out their work & impact from their own view? 
> I think it might be important to set the right tone. I personally would like a culture where ppl are encouraged to shamelessly advocate for themselves. at least all performance conversations I'm used to start from the individual giving an overview / advocating for the impact of their work. also if this isn't encouraged then only the more visible & top of mind people / projects might get voted for since there is no new information to consider holistically. 

* are voters (beyond the person nominating) going to be able to share supporting comments (reasons) associated with their vote?
> I think this would be a key way in which people that worked closely to an individual or a project can offer their view on the details and impact of the work. I think this and the question above can help reduce the likelihood of the ""Nightmare Scenario"" outlined in the doc where ppl feel hurt due to ""feeling underrecognized by peers"".

* what is the time period of the impact we're evaluating?
> easy / fair approach could be all past contribution since inception. but then again maybe we don't have enough ETH for since inception. or maybe we do. idk. 

* how do we gauge success? 
> the strongest signal for me would be if the rewardees' long-term contribution trajectory towards the DAO moves up materially. the number of people that had gone somewhat inactive but turned active again. the number of on-chain proposals or prop house proposals submitted by rewardees. maybe even a survey of the rewardees asking them if the rewards have had any boost in their good will, feeling of being fairly compensated / respected, desire to take on a more ambitious project has increased after the program.

Why don't we divide into to few smaller nouncil-groups of 5-10 nouncilors and rotate voting responsibilities for prop.house between nouncil-groups? 

Maybe for PropHouse 5, Nouncil APAC can take full responsibility to review and allocate nouncil-votes? We can report back to Nouncil during weekly call. Later, same approach can be used to accept new applicants etc

However, Bigshot Klim#1853 mentioned that there will be a special code for claims, allowing anyone in the community to get a wholesale rate for their orders, possibly even less. For Australian members, they are considering shipping a large case to someone in Australia to distribute locally, as shipping from the US to Australia can be expensive and have high VAT. Benbodhi#1111 volunteered to handle this distribution."

Nouncil Meeting 12a - APAC
Audio and Notes

Notes from Nouncil Meeting 12a - APAC

**1. Coral Orca Final Discussion**
    - 2 of us have made our views clear in the discord chats already.
    - Additional: Coral has been around for a long time, one misdemeanour shouldn‚Äôt remove him from nouncil, but grants removed makes sense.

**2. Code of conduct**
    - Privileged position  - don‚Äôt take it for granted
    - The Defining Triangle: three parties who's interest Nouncillors consider
        1. People seeking funding to proliferate Nouns (Prop house applicants)
        2. People who own Nouns (Nounders/Nouners)
        3. People who represent Noun interests (Nouncillors)
    - It is expected that nouncillors act in the best interests of all parties and that nouncillors don't abuse their position.
    
    **Disciplinary Procedures/Options**
    - Instant dismissal mentioned as punishment for gaming votes/cheating going forward
    - Removal of permissionless grant eligibility (removed for a round or more)
    - Removal of wag retro rewards eligibility (removed for a round or more)

    - If you had any grant eligibility removed, could you get it back?
        - through actions (make up for it)
        - through time (wait a period of time)

**3. Permissionless Grant**
    - Let's offer it to new nouncillors
        - Submit a round of ideas
        - Nouncil vote for top 6 to get 1eth each for their idea
    - Permissionless grant thread not visible to thaswami, maybe others... is this intended to display only to eligible nouncillors?
    - Need to add clear Permissionless Grant info to the welcome doc, with links to the docs or embedded.

**4. Voting Participation**
    - New nouncillors weren‚Äôt aware of the % expectation of voting to keep ‚Äúnouncillor in good standing‚Äù - let‚Äôs make it clear, is it to do with eligibility for rewards?
    - Maybe now we have the welcome doc, we can make it clear that your voting participation should remain above a certain percentage.
    - votes witnessed reset or new column ""votes witnessed since participation rule"" after rule is in place officially.
    - If no reset, new nouncillors hwo missed some votes recently will take quite a few votes to get back above 69%.
    - Maybe a different percentage threshold?
    - If a nouncillor knows in advance that they can‚Äôt vote (will be inactive in discord for a known time), their activity level could drop - how to deal with that?
    
    - punishment for not voting on the prop - unable to vote on the next prop? Doesn't seem like punishment.

**5. No Open Votes To Discuss**

**6. Multi-Sig**
    - We could break 24hr time into 6hr blocks, having 2 signers in each 6hr timezone block so there‚Äôs rollover into any timezone. 2 of 8 wallet.
        - How to decide signers?
        - Would allow for a combo of entirely different people to sign off - what's the risk?
    - Reward to be one of the 8 signers? Maybe a Discord role?
        - Optics is good for ‚Äúgovernance status‚Äù if you can be trsuted with a multi sig.
    - Easiest option right now without taking on much more trust dynamic is 1 more person added to make 2 of 4.
        - Make sure they're in the most relevant timezone to sync with existing holders and/or timely voting.

**7. Reminder to make some nominations for the Wag Retro Rewards.**",

1) We need roles for all voting members. And potentially roles for working members (like secondary reps from projects eg) and
2) A gated channel for voting separate from this discussion channel. 

Does anyone have the ear of a nounder to see if those are possible?","Yes, it is possible to create roles for voting members and a gated channel for voting separate from the discussion channel. In the conversation, JoelCares#5898 requested a NOUNCILLOR role and a #nouncil-vote channel from a Discord admin. 4156#9052 later mentioned that they had set up the role and were open to creating a separate channel for voting if necessary."

What about CC0 collections / groups like CryptoVanz that are influenced by Nouns but in a less obvious way? A few of their vans have noggles, but not many. There's quite a few collections like this.

Nouncil members can put up proposals by undelegating and submitting their proposal on-chain.

The proposal needs to pass a Nouncil vote that confirms they want to put it on chain."

However, Noun 40#8015 suggests that there would be a fair amount of Nouners who would enthusiastically vote for a purely Noadz film to be made, and it's worth putting a proposal forward. Toady_Hawk#8950 also mentions that proposals from Noun derivatives could be considered, so it might be worth trying."

<@362737590430072862> you've asked/encouraged numerous times for feedback from those who don't talk much on Nouncil calls. And you never gets answers. As someone who doesn't talk much on the call, but isn't hesitant to share my thoughts and talk other places, I'll share some thoughts that may resonate with others and help you and Nouncil overall. 

The people who talk most are a few people who started Nouncil, know Nouners (in fact at least 1 actual Nouner), are on the Nouner call, know the history of props and politics. All in a way that dwarfs most of the rest of us. Add to that the proposer of the prop often talks. So, I view the Nouncil call as the time when I get my crash course in the prop so that I can responsibly vote. I take my votes with a lot of responsibility and look into them quite a bit and am bothered (probably more than I should be) when I'm on the fence, can't decide, or go/want to go against the crowd. So, between all the speaking that goes on above, the time constraints, the banter etc. the only reason I would speak is if I have some insight that others wouldn't have or a question to help clarify that others aren't asking. Outside of that, I'm going to listen for the most part until such time as I'm the one who knows enough to speak in a valuable way. This allows me to govern responsibly. The Nouncil call is where I get fully informed and serves an important role as it is for Nouncillors to govern. I don't see it as a negative that a few people speak 93% of the time, since I have that view of the call. 

Hope that helps. Follow up welcome if helpful.",

Don't get me wrong: I still buy stuff üòÖ ‚Äî but as solid as the proposal is, and as dope as the gear looks, I just personally wasn't 100 on it. There was also one other aspect that factored in for me, though, and that's the overlap of CC0 and DIY culture. While having premium cut-and-sew pieces proliferates nouns at a certain level‚Äîand does nothing to prohibit the proliferation of nouns in the DIY space‚Äîit feels a bit too far removed from it (for me)‚Ä¶more exclusive than inclusive and therefore *slightly* counter-nounish (‚Ä¶again: to me).

Do you think its too much with two IRL things at NFT NYC?

Imo i dont think they should be competing for attention / treasury funds and both can be great ways to proliferate nouns. However, 88 eth is a pretty hefty ask, and the ‚ÄùROI‚Äù looks smaller compared to the vectorDAO proposal? Perhaps the comparison is inevitable

Can you help me solve a mess I made in the course of creating on Nouns? 

I  transferred my personal artist contract admin to NounsDAO (rather than transferring the token as intended when trying to send Nouns the ERC1155 that I'd committed to deliver). This contract is important and can't easily be recreated. It would make a significant difference to me if I can get it back.

I've had some conversation with Solamander on the dev channel (https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/877215225093451776/992486615723286598) and it would require an on-chain proposal to send the the admin back. I asked if they would be willing to support, but so far no responses after a couple of days.

I realise it's a significant pain and apologies for the time wasted. Would you be willing to support on-chain proposal to do transfer this back to my wallet, or have any other suggestions? My only argument why this in the Nouns interest is that I did this in the course of creating for Nouns, and in my efforts to deliver on my proposal commitment. 

This is the transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xeb10dd0e19f808361c7e5343f8b40f5863d060987df9ae3223b57356ca5d6c47

Whats the reason? maybe  <@812369752382373890> can make some adjustments to have you in favour?

I personally think that it is a great idea to proliferate cc0 in the NFT space and therefore establishing nouns as THE cc0 ambassador for NFTs and web3.

Maybe you can make a AMA with <@812369752382373890>","The question was about the reasons for the majority leaning against the CC0 image bank proposal. Some reasons mentioned in the conversation include:

1. samellis ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®#4764: Wants to see a better way to let people know that the project was funded by Nouns and suggests adding an art contest to the proposal to bring more awareness to Nouns and the project.
2. maty#0984: Didn't see much overlap with Nouns and wasn't sure if it's the best use of resources.
3. andrewladdusaw#8362: Concerned about the visibility of the site with 30 images among other sites with millions of copyright-free photos and questions why Nouns would take on the project when other sites would host the pictures at no cost.

Some users, like SerNoadz#3802 and Benbodhi#1111, expressed support for the proposal, liking the idea of establishing NounsDAO as a leader in CC0 and appreciating the space art aspect. They also agreed with the idea of running a nounish artwork contest with the images to make the proposal better."

If you're working on a Nouns DAO project and being compensated would you have any interest in being compensated with some kind of $NOUN fractional token with connection to governance, possibly something that eventually adds up to a full Noun. Or would you prefer to always be paid the same amount in ETH?","Based on the direct reply from sidenoun#1868, there is no clear consensus on whether Nouns DAO project contributors would prefer to be compensated with a $NOUN fractional token or ETH.

 - ""Some revenues will flow back to Nouns DAO"" Personally I would focus less on this. It's not something that the DAO has done before, and while people are open to it, it's very unknown territory. Unless a Nouner steps in with enthusiasm and direction regarding returning revenue to the DAO, I consider this a big unknown. Nouners reading this, feel free to jump in and disagree.

 - that being said ""From here we can waterfall revenues back into Nouns DAO."" this is a strong statement. And possibly something worth considering for the DAO. But also - it's new territory and I imagine you encountering friction here.

 - This proposal is focused on the AirBNB as a business. Do you think branding an AirBNB with Nouns will increase the price you are able to charge? Would it be a strong business choice even without DAO funding?

 - The Doodles example is at an SXSW event. I would 100% go to a Nouns tent at SXSW, and I imagine it was free for pass holders anyways. At the moment I don't imagine myself drawn to staying at a Nouns AirBNB.

 - the acrylic figures seem expensive

  - the AirBnb Shopping Lis and the property holding costs... if Nouns is getting a stake in the business, and revenue, these expenses make sense. But, unless Nouns is fully on board with that aspect, these costs  don't fit

I don't think this proposal would pass an on-chain vote. We could do an informal Nouncil poll if you need to see it. 

But! Your furniture is awesome. You have great energy, and have clearly put a lot of thought into this.  I would propose starting with the clearest, most obvious and excellent part of the project: Nouns custom furniture & wall art. You could probably get that supported right now, and can keep developing your ideas and talking with Nouners to try and get a big picture project approved.","It is suggested that instead of focusing on the Nouns-themed Airbnb as a whole, the proposer should start with the clearest and most obvious part of the project: Nouns custom furniture & wall art.

There are two main issues people have brought forth regarding this proposal, perhaps you can address them.

1. We have a lot of streetwear and related recently funded - why do we want more?
2. As you noted, this is something related to being a founding partner of a business - this isn't a nouns-specific endeavor. While we did go off the rails for a few things that we recently funded, we are dialing things back to those which are more nouns-focused. How is this nouns-centric?","In response to the two main issues:

1. The reason for wanting more streetwear-related funding is due to the strong alignment of cultural values between Nouns and Dopamine. Dopamine aims to be the first community-owned streetwear brand in web3, with Nouns being their biggest inspiration. This partnership would help bolster Nouns' reputation as leaders and incubators of the next wave of creativity.

2. This proposal is Nouns-centric because the authentication and distribution model around Dopamine's non-fungible streetwear incorporates an on-chain, decentralized approach. The microchips in the clothing will be hardware wallets themselves, with signatures linking to a Nouns-specific brand registry that lives entirely on-chain. This is unlike existing models that use centralized middleware or registries. In this sense, Nouns would be helping champion truly web3 homegrown technology."

actually couple weeks ago, in the post-nouncil hangout call i _ALREADY_ brought up what would it look like to split up 8 nouns into 4 voting blocks of 2.

as groups get bigger, it's hard to accomplish tasks or get people actually involved. we're at what, 40-ish folks? how many would you say are fairly active/invovled already, besides simply emoji voting? probably 1/3? 

i dont think we're at a problem state by any means now, i personally am just a very execution-first kinda guy and so i trend towards small groups to ensure shit gets done (usually groups of 1, ie why most my projects are solo ha). 

i don't love the idea of capping anything because it's enacting some rule, right? I wouldn't want someone to feel they didn't _deserve_ to be here and that us here are ""lucky"" cause we're already ""in"". i think we just let the experiment play out for now. inactive nouncillors isn't currently a problem, we're not anywhere near not reaching quorum where inactivity will stunt us, i just think its just sad to see and a missed opportunity for said folks. i really love the nouncil and want us to be a strong example of governing as a group. i love that we aren't afraid to speak a dissenting opinion, while realizing we can like the person but disagree on prop details, i think that largely comes down to the fact that we dont own these nouns, just exercise them. so we dont care as much about social pressures (i.e. abstaining when you _want_ to vote no).

i digress, the nouncil feeling ""bloated"" for members in it is just one opinion, for a newcomer it can be incredibly exciting to join nouns day 1 and find the nouncil and immediately feel connected to 50+ people. that's a positive for sure, creating community (forgive the cheesy expression). i'll always kick us in the butt to make sure we're moving along with the things we said we'd do. sometimes that just invovles smaller pods. i reach out to nouncillors, or subgroups of nouncillors, specifically when i need something answered/done that may get lost in the general channel. 

i think we do have a ""nouncil function and mission"" (voting, proposing, taking part in nouns goverenance) and we should follow-through on the couple of projects we've already started before looking to whats next/when to cap this thing. lets make sure this thing is _the thing_ we all think it is and we can deliver upon that before thinking through how to change it.

Nounish is an intrinsic quality of things which, when it‚Äôs perceived, pleases the mind by a certain kind of fittingness to the Nouns community. It can be used to describe physical or digital objects and general values.

Why should people come here ?
What will draw peoples attention ?
Should I just focus on the benches ?

First, I'd like to address that none of the revnues flow into my personal pocket. My management company will take a management fee but that is all. 100% of profits will be flowing back to the DAO in some way shape or form.

It's best to think of this Nounsbnb as a pilot program, As stated in the proposal. With Nounsbnb we can create immersive experiences on the small scale level which will eventually transfer over to more larger events .. like the doodles activation currently going on at SXSW. 

But to be honest there's something I've purposely left out of the proposal which is the details of how I will be making the connection between the metaverse & IRL in Nounsbnb. I did this for 2 reasons.

1. Build anticipation
2. Keep someone from stealing my ideas before me.

But to give some teasers... I will be working with some web3 native companies to keep the nouns brand imprinted in guest minds. I would like to collaborate with nouns shop to create welcome packages filled with Nouns gear. I'd like to collaborate with artist in the nounspere to potentially have their art ( canvas, sculptures, digital art) up for sale in the unit. I'd like to collaborate with [redacted] to offer experiences at sports events, musicals, dinners, movies, plays &  give discounts on certain stores IRL & online. The kicker is ... this will all be gamified in a way to promote adoption of web3 tech ,NFTs, but most importantly Nouns brand. 
(feel like I've said too much already but there is much more)

Now, I like the point about the exterior. The unit just so happens to be hovering the only freeway/highway/bridge leading out of town... I can come up with something to potentially hang from the balcony .. or maybe I can get custom curtain and put a QR code on it ... because the windows facing the free way are true floor to ceiling. so people will definitely be able to see... and maybe I can get some customized lights to make sure its visible when its dark. People riding by can potentially scan the code and be directed to something nouns related (just thinking out loud this is not final)",

Nouncil Meeting 12a - APAC
Audio and Notes

Notes from Nouncil Meeting 12a - APAC

**1. Coral Orca Final Discussion**
    - 2 of us have made our views clear in the discord chats already.
    - Additional: Coral has been around for a long time, one misdemeanour shouldn‚Äôt remove him from nouncil, but grants removed makes sense.

**2. Code of conduct**
    - Privileged position  - don‚Äôt take it for granted
    - The Defining Triangle: three parties who's interest Nouncillors consider
        1. People seeking funding to proliferate Nouns (Prop house applicants)
        2. People who own Nouns (Nounders/Nouners)
        3. People who represent Noun interests (Nouncillors)
    - It is expected that nouncillors act in the best interests of all parties and that nouncillors don't abuse their position.
    
    **Disciplinary Procedures/Options**
    - Instant dismissal mentioned as punishment for gaming votes/cheating going forward
    - Removal of permissionless grant eligibility (removed for a round or more)
    - Removal of wag retro rewards eligibility (removed for a round or more)

    - If you had any grant eligibility removed, could you get it back?
        - through actions (make up for it)
        - through time (wait a period of time)

**3. Permissionless Grant**
    - Let's offer it to new nouncillors
        - Submit a round of ideas
        - Nouncil vote for top 6 to get 1eth each for their idea
    - Permissionless grant thread not visible to thaswami, maybe others... is this intended to display only to eligible nouncillors?
    - Need to add clear Permissionless Grant info to the welcome doc, with links to the docs or embedded.

**4. Voting Participation**
    - New nouncillors weren‚Äôt aware of the % expectation of voting to keep ‚Äúnouncillor in good standing‚Äù - let‚Äôs make it clear, is it to do with eligibility for rewards?
    - Maybe now we have the welcome doc, we can make it clear that your voting participation should remain above a certain percentage.
    - votes witnessed reset or new column ""votes witnessed since participation rule"" after rule is in place officially.
    - If no reset, new nouncillors hwo missed some votes recently will take quite a few votes to get back above 69%.
    - Maybe a different percentage threshold?
    - If a nouncillor knows in advance that they can‚Äôt vote (will be inactive in discord for a known time), their activity level could drop - how to deal with that?
    
    - punishment for not voting on the prop - unable to vote on the next prop? Doesn't seem like punishment.

**5. No Open Votes To Discuss**

**6. Multi-Sig**
    - We could break 24hr time into 6hr blocks, having 2 signers in each 6hr timezone block so there‚Äôs rollover into any timezone. 2 of 8 wallet.
        - How to decide signers?
        - Would allow for a combo of entirely different people to sign off - what's the risk?
    - Reward to be one of the 8 signers? Maybe a Discord role?
        - Optics is good for ‚Äúgovernance status‚Äù if you can be trsuted with a multi sig.
    - Easiest option right now without taking on much more trust dynamic is 1 more person added to make 2 of 4.
        - Make sure they're in the most relevant timezone to sync with existing holders and/or timely voting.

**7. Reminder to make some nominations for the Wag Retro Rewards.**",

<@362737590430072862> you've asked/encouraged numerous times for feedback from those who don't talk much on Nouncil calls. And you never gets answers. As someone who doesn't talk much on the call, but isn't hesitant to share my thoughts and talk other places, I'll share some thoughts that may resonate with others and help you and Nouncil overall. 

The people who talk most are a few people who started Nouncil, know Nouners (in fact at least 1 actual Nouner), are on the Nouner call, know the history of props and politics. All in a way that dwarfs most of the rest of us. Add to that the proposer of the prop often talks. So, I view the Nouncil call as the time when I get my crash course in the prop so that I can responsibly vote. I take my votes with a lot of responsibility and look into them quite a bit and am bothered (probably more than I should be) when I'm on the fence, can't decide, or go/want to go against the crowd. So, between all the speaking that goes on above, the time constraints, the banter etc. the only reason I would speak is if I have some insight that others wouldn't have or a question to help clarify that others aren't asking. Outside of that, I'm going to listen for the most part until such time as I'm the one who knows enough to speak in a valuable way. This allows me to govern responsibly. The Nouncil call is where I get fully informed and serves an important role as it is for Nouncillors to govern. I don't see it as a negative that a few people speak 93% of the time, since I have that view of the call. 

Hope that helps. Follow up welcome if helpful.",

I  transferred my personal artist contract admin to NounsDAO (rather than transferring the token as intended when trying to send Nouns the ERC1155 that I'd committed to deliver). This contract is important and can't easily be recreated. It would make a significant difference to me if I can get it back.

I asked if they would be willing to support, but so far no responses after a couple of days.

I realise it's a significant pain and apologies for the time wasted. Would you be willing to support on-chain proposal to do transfer this back to my wallet, or have any other suggestions? My only argument why this in the Nouns interest is that I did this in the course of creating for Nouns, and in my efforts to deliver on my proposal commitment.

3) Joel has also moved the Google Doc drive with the Mission Statement in it from his own account into thenouncil Google account, we will use this document to workshop and get feedback on content like this because it's hard to do so in the chat.

Please when editing, copy, paste and suggest edits in a new paragraph so we don't lose versions. 

4) I've made a Medium account for us linked to the same gmail for now, no content yet but it is live at: https://medium.com/@nouncil
We've talked about workshopping a short Introduction to the Nouncil to be published on the medium so may be asking you for a short blurb about your project (or we can default to using the one written by <@!860360610066595860> if you prefer), and then we'll make our inaugural tweet from @ nouncil on twitter with a link to the medium to ""go public.""

Whats the reason? maybe  <@812369752382373890> can make some adjustments to have you in favour?

I personally think that it is a great idea to proliferate cc0 in the NFT space and therefore establishing nouns as THE cc0 ambassador for NFTs and web3.

1. samellis ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®#4764: Wants to see a better way to let people know that the project was funded by Nouns and suggests adding an art contest to the proposal to bring more awareness to Nouns and the project.
2. maty#0984: Didn't see much overlap with Nouns and wasn't sure if it's the best use of resources.
3. andrewladdusaw#8362: Concerned about the visibility of the site with 30 images among other sites with millions of copyright-free photos and questions why Nouns would take on the project when other sites would host the pictures at no cost.

Some users, like SerNoadz#3802 and Benbodhi#1111, expressed support for the proposal, liking the idea of establishing NounsDAO as a leader in CC0 and appreciating the space art aspect. They also agreed with the idea of running a nounish artwork contest with the images to make the proposal better."

I really have no idea. I'm left to googling 'how much to back-end developers make?' (way less than 500k / year btw).

Soon, we'll have a prop on chain for 2 million dollars for 66 minutes of video. How can we possibly figure out if that's worth it?

It's not my money so I probably shouldn't care that much, but I'm not sure that we're able to do proper due diligence on any of these things as individuals, and that doesn't sit well with me as the props get larger.

So, a #summary channel where you would check what happened in all the channels with timestamps and links to some of the best discussions.
We could possibly expand to derivatives/extensions as well.

Are you following the conversation in <#873197966373052426>? I wanted to bring up a specific point here, because as BUIDLers this is probably a question we can answer.

QUESTION
If you're working on a Nouns DAO project and being compensated would you have any interest in being compensated with some kind of $NOUN fractional token with connection to governance, possibly something that eventually adds up to a full Noun. Or would you prefer to always be paid the same amount in ETH?","Based on the direct reply from sidenoun#1868, there is no clear consensus on whether Nouns DAO project contributors would prefer to be compensated with a $NOUN fractional token or ETH. However, sidenoun#1868 suggests that a split between the two might be a good idea, and that motivation to continue working on the project after receiving a Noun could be a concern. They also mention the possibility of working towards a Noun until one is rewarded, and then deciding on the preferred form of payment afterward."

 - The furniture is awesome. I think if you were to do a pilot pilot project of just Nouns Furniture (with CC0 plans released online!) you would have success.

 - ""Some revenues will flow back to Nouns DAO"" Personally I would focus less on this. It's not something that the DAO has done before, and while people are open to it, it's very unknown territory. Unless a Nouner steps in with enthusiasm and direction regarding returning revenue to the DAO, I consider this a big unknown. Nouners reading this, feel free to jump in and disagree.

 - that being said ""From here we can waterfall revenues back into Nouns DAO."" this is a strong statement. And possibly something worth considering for the DAO. But also - it's new territory and I imagine you encountering friction here.

 - This proposal is focused on the AirBNB as a business. Do you think branding an AirBNB with Nouns will increase the price you are able to charge? Would it be a strong business choice even without DAO funding?

 - The Doodles example is at an SXSW event. I would 100% go to a Nouns tent at SXSW, and I imagine it was free for pass holders anyways. At the moment I don't imagine myself drawn to staying at a Nouns AirBNB.

 - the acrylic figures seem expensive

  - the AirBnb Shopping Lis and the property holding costs... if Nouns is getting a stake in the business, and revenue, these expenses make sense. But, unless Nouns is fully on board with that aspect, these costs  don't fit

There are two main issues people have brought forth regarding this proposal, perhaps you can address them.

1. We have a lot of streetwear and related recently funded - why do we want more?
2. As you noted, this is something related to being a founding partner of a business - this isn't a nouns-specific endeavor. While we did go off the rails for a few things that we recently funded, we are dialing things back to those which are more nouns-focused. How is this nouns-centric?","In response to the two main issues:

1. The reason for wanting more streetwear-related funding is due to the strong alignment of cultural values between Nouns and Dopamine. Dopamine aims to be the first community-owned streetwear brand in web3, with Nouns being their biggest inspiration. This partnership would help bolster Nouns' reputation as leaders and incubators of the next wave of creativity.

2. This proposal is Nouns-centric because the authentication and distribution model around Dopamine's non-fungible streetwear incorporates an on-chain, decentralized approach.

actually couple weeks ago, in the post-nouncil hangout call i _ALREADY_ brought up what would it look like to split up 8 nouns into 4 voting blocks of 2.

as groups get bigger, it's hard to accomplish tasks or get people actually involved. we're at what, 40-ish folks? how many would you say are fairly active/invovled already, besides simply emoji voting? probably 1/3? 

i dont think we're at a problem state by any means now, i personally am just a very execution-first kinda guy and so i trend towards small groups to ensure shit gets done (usually groups of 1, ie why most my projects are solo ha). 

i don't love the idea of capping anything because it's enacting some rule, right? I wouldn't want someone to feel they didn't _deserve_ to be here and that us here are ""lucky"" cause we're already ""in"". i think we just let the experiment play out for now. inactive nouncillors isn't currently a problem, we're not anywhere near not reaching quorum where inactivity will stunt us, i just think its just sad to see and a missed opportunity for said folks. i really love the nouncil and want us to be a strong example of governing as a group. i love that we aren't afraid to speak a dissenting opinion, while realizing we can like the person but disagree on prop details, i think that largely comes down to the fact that we dont own these nouns, just exercise them. so we dont care as much about social pressures (i.e. abstaining when you _want_ to vote no).

i digress, the nouncil feeling ""bloated"" for members in it is just one opinion, for a newcomer it can be incredibly exciting to join nouns day 1 and find the nouncil and immediately feel connected to 50+ people. that's a positive for sure, creating community (forgive the cheesy expression). i'll always kick us in the butt to make sure we're moving along with the things we said we'd do. sometimes that just invovles smaller pods. i reach out to nouncillors, or subgroups of nouncillors, specifically when i need something answered/done that may get lost in the general channel. 

i think we do have a ""nouncil function and mission"" (voting, proposing, taking part in nouns goverenance) and we should follow-through on the couple of projects we've already started before looking to whats next/when to cap this thing. lets make sure this thing is _the thing_ we all think it is and we can deliver upon that before thinking through how to change it.

Why should people come here ?
What will draw peoples attention ?
Should I just focus on the benches ?

First, I'd like to address that none of the revnues flow into my personal pocket. My management company will take a management fee but that is all. 100% of profits will be flowing back to the DAO in some way shape or form.

It's best to think of this Nounsbnb as a pilot program, As stated in the proposal. With Nounsbnb we can create immersive experiences on the small scale level which will eventually transfer over to more larger events .. like the doodles activation currently going on at SXSW. 

But to be honest there's something I've purposely left out of the proposal which is the details of how I will be making the connection between the metaverse & IRL in Nounsbnb. I did this for 2 reasons.

1. Build anticipation
2. Keep someone from stealing my ideas before me.

But to give some teasers... I will be working with some web3 native companies to keep the nouns brand imprinted in guest minds. I would like to collaborate with nouns shop to create welcome packages filled with Nouns gear. I'd like to collaborate with artist in the nounspere to potentially have their art ( canvas, sculptures, digital art) up for sale in the unit. I'd like to collaborate with [redacted] to offer experiences at sports events, musicals, dinners, movies, plays &  give discounts on certain stores IRL & online. The kicker is ... this will all be gamified in a way to promote adoption of web3 tech ,NFTs, but most importantly Nouns brand. 
(feel like I've said too much already but there is much more)

Now, I like the point about the exterior. The unit just so happens to be hovering the only freeway/highway/bridge leading out of town... I can come up with something to potentially hang from the balcony .. or maybe I can get custom curtain and put a QR code on it ... because the windows facing the free way are true floor to ceiling. so people will definitely be able to see... and maybe I can get some customized lights to make sure its visible when its dark. People riding by can potentially scan the code and be directed to something nouns related (just thinking out loud this is not final)",

Yes! I have some comparable data on how much other esports teams are sponsored for and what they receive in return. Let's start with Dota as an example. Our team is currently ranked 3rd out of the 16 teams that compete in the Pro Circuit in North America, and we are proposing to pay our players up to $4000 per month.

In comparison, the two teams ranked above us in Dota are Shopify Rebellion and TSM. Shopify Rebellion players, historically one of the most dominant NA teams, are making around $20,000 per month. TSM brought in a new squad consisting of international players from regions across the world and receive between $5000 to $7000 per month.

In South America, the top two teams that we've competed against historically receive $9000 and $12,000 per month, respectively.

In the CS:GO vertical, our players are also receiving up to $4000 per month. The most dominant teams in North America are Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses. Team Liquid is one of the best teams internationally and has a long history in esports. While every player on their team likely makes six figures of salary, star players on independent contracts likely earn upwards of $20-30k per month. Generally speaking all the top teams are making six-figures of salary.

Evil Geniuses is running a unique program in CS:GO with a ""main"" roster and two training squads, ""White"" and ""Black."" Their training rosters earn $5000 per month, while their main roster likely earns double that.

In both game verticals we believe we've identified and are working with teams that fit in a sweet spot of skill, player notoriety, and cost.

So what do these esports orgs get in return?  Attention. They are brands that sell content and association with their content. In Shopify Rebellion's case, they have no additional sponsors, but in the case of teams like Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses, esports native brands, they have a sleeve full of sponsors who pay to be a part of the team's journey.","Other esports teams are sponsored for varying amounts depending on their ranking and performance. For example, in Dota, Shopify Rebellion players make around $20,000 per month, while TSM players receive between $5,000 to $7,000 per month. In the CS:GO vertical, top teams like Team Liquid have players making six-figure salaries, with star players earning upwards of $20-30k per month. Evil Geniuses' main roster likely earns double the $5,000 per month that their training rosters receive.

In return for sponsorship, esports organizations gain attention and brand recognition. They sell content and association with their content, attracting both endemic and non-endemic sponsors who pay to be part of the team's journey."

Regarding the benefits brought to Nouns from our esports endeavors with the funding already received. We have clearly established ourselves in the realm of esports, and now receive regular press about our efforts. Nouners often join for a mixture of different activities across Nouns, but I want to say that in some part we have moved the needle on the overall decision people make when they join, especially if they're a gamer, which I know we have quite a few of in the DAO at this point. Some of my favorite Nouner joins, in which I think we can clearly take credit, are Jason and Brian from Patron, who joined after and in part due to hearing about our esports efforts & Dota team. Both of them provided testimonials that we included in our last proposal, 119 https://i.imgur.com/nnp2pBk.png","The benefits brought to Nouns from the esports endeavors with the funding already received include establishing the Nouns brand in the esports realm, receiving regular press about their efforts, and attracting new members to the DAO.

I appreciate your perspective on the conversion impact of this proposal. While it's true that two people buying nouns doesn't move the needle long term, I'll point out that it DID make our first proposal contribute net ETH gain to the treasury. Additionally, I think it's true that our esports proposals have helped move the needle on more casual gaming fans committing to joining Nouns. I understand and agree with your point that we need to consider the long-term impact on the DAO, and that is exactly why I'm so supportive of this initiative.

Let's take Prop 245 as an example since it's something we both support. This proposal is the pilot of a longer ambition to make a Nouns movie and have Nouns become a prevalent publisher of quality media. It creates the opportunity for Nouns to be in front of millions of viewers, and while the net bid from Nouners who join due to the film in the first year of publication might not outpace the cost of this film, we know that the long-term impact of having a successful movie published by the DAO, spreading our art and culture, will be immense over the years.

Similarly, our esports proposal offers the opportunity to build a brand with lasting impact. Creating a lasting esports organization that aligns with Nounish values and extends our culture to a wider audience is a significant step in this direction. Esports teams can establish themselves as legacy brands, with powerful audiences that can meaningfully monetize and empower their organizations through fandom. 

Our esports proposal offers an innovative experience for gamers to participate in the decision-making of an esports org. There are no other esports teams where you can join and have a seat at the table in a transparent ecosystem, and Nouns is reimagining how the industry should operate. Less than one year in esports is a flash in the pan team, not yet worthy of the following of an esports fan who's been supporting their game for a decade+. We need to show our commitment to the community for them to truly take notice. This is how we convert this very hardcore and dedicated audience.

The way I view it, Nouns is already a team. What drives the fandom? The culture. When we extend this culture to esports, it's radically different from what most of the community has experienced, and many have found it immediately endearing. Wait until we have a Nounish video explaining how it all works to the average gamer, I expect it to be some of their most viewed content. By participating at the highest level of competition in some of the most popular games in the world, and creating a lasting brand, we can reach out to millions of gamers and create an evergreen impact.

In addition, gaming and crypto are becoming more intertwined, and this proposal is a great opportunity for Nouns to speak natively with gamers and extend our culture in an authentic way. This can help us attract new members who align with our values and expand our community.

Thank you again for your feedback, and I look forward to continuing the conversation <:nouns_def_salute:999878787057598494>","The esports proposal aims to build a lasting brand with a significant impact by creating a unique experience for gamers to participate in the decision-making of an esports organization.

If you are spending $10k on something amorphous, ok, get wild.  If you're spending $800k on brand awareness for 1 year, it should be tighter and clearer that it's impactful.

Re: partnership opportunities.  This seems like opportunities to spend money with another organization for more advertising?

Re: ""Overall, sponsoring an esports team can provide a DAO with a valuable opportunity to connect with a highly engaged and passionate community, increase brand awareness, and potentially drive adoption and usage of their products and services.""

Is this worth $Xmm/yr?  The relationship ends when we stop paying money to teams to sponsor them or we stop sponsoring events.  How do we capture the attention in a way that justifies that spend per year? What does that look like?  If our esports organization was stood up and had inflows of its own that were material, that's a different story, then an organization that is radical is being created, one that presumably would have to share in the wins of its rosters financially and continually participates in their growth and ours brand's growth and reach and reputation.  But it's clear that won't happen anytime soon and maybe can't happen and also it was alluded to that that would somehow make this cost more.  So right now, Nouns DAO pays money and the moment it stops, there's not an organization.  $800k/yr from this Prop plus the amounts spent to stand up the pod, that's a substantial amount of money relative to our inflows for something that right now stops when we stop spending.  That makes it unlike most things -- this is advertising, a lot of it, until its effectively harnessed and funneled into the DAO in ways that haven't happened yet.","Sponsoring an esports team can provide a DAO with a valuable opportunity to connect with a highly engaged and passionate community, increase brand awareness, and potentially drive adoption and usage of their products and services. By sponsoring an esports team, the DAO can reach a highly engaged and targeted audience.

However, it is important to consider the sustainability of the pod and the balance between the amount of spend and the value brought to the DAO."
68,1092093144352444618,263-nouns-esports-csgo-and-dota2-rosters-2023,1034365088695599155,The Jungle: Nouns DAO,,,,"Thank you for the questions!

**1)** 
We consider funds delegated to the Pod to still inherently belong to Nouns. We're responsible for delegation and execution of use. For our first merch drop, we're working with a streetwear-esque supplier https://mf9.store/ to provide quality merch. We regularly receive comments asking for merch, and we expect our first release to sell out quickly. We'll also have our jerseys available for sale via print on demand. As merch production funds have been converted to fiat, and we will be receiving revenue back in fiat, we plan to reinvest all revenue back into producing larger merch quantities for the foreseeable future. Inevitably, we would have no problem providing kickback to Nouns if our merch strategy is sustainable and profitable.

**2)** 
As part of our negotiations with both our CS:GO and Dota Rosters, we did not request any cut of their tournament winnings for this proposal. We made this decision for several reasons. Primarily, it allowed us to significantly reduce the overall cost of the proposal. Additionally, there is some degree of friction with bringing funds back to the DAO due to legal and tax reasons. Furthermore, we believe that taking a significant revenue share from the players is not ideal, given our transparent model. Top teams typically do not take more than 10% (if any) of tournament winnings, and this is seen more as a way to create value-alignment rather than a major revenue driver for orgs. While we would consider a small revenue share back to Nouns in future deals with teams, for our younger organization, we decided to opt out of this arrangement for the current season.

**3) ** 
I look at sustainability in a few ways in the context of the unique intermingling of Nouns and Esports...

Is our project creating bid demand for Nouns? Albeit unclear to quantify, historically, we've already done that and have been attributed for doing so (see my response to Hindsight above).

Can we achieve partnerships or create opportunities worth significant revenue? One of the tournaments we are participating in this coming month will have organization rewards up to $100,000. This is based on social and performance metrics. If our team qualifies for the next stage of the circuit, that team incentive will 3x, up to $300,000. As we continue to cement ourselves as an established brand (many top orgs are decades old while we're still within our first year), we believe partnership inflow will continue to increase. Another partnership example, which I don't want to promise is happening because it's still early, is being paid as an organization to field a roster and compete in a particular game (a very popular FPS). This would also be a six-figure deal, but likely a significant portion is expected to go directly back into investing in the team.

Sponsors? What if Nouns Esports had sponsors other than Nouns? Well, that is something we are pursuing and exploring. We've already been approached by what I would call ""low-hanging fruit"" sponsors, e.g. betting, but what we are really looking for are ideal partners that are culturally aligned with Nouns. For example, Coinbase and Uniswap both sponsor Dota teams, why shouldn't they sponsor the Nouns team? Nouns, due to the art, culture, and technological innovation from the community, is one of the best places to onboard people into crypto. I believe subcommunity efforts, like Esports and Gnars, are the future of onboarding as top-of-funnel tools for Nouns. What if we were also top of funnel onboarding for Base, Coinbase's new L2? Proof of Gamer & That's Gnarly would certainly benefit from lower friction experiences on L2, and Nouns would benefit from Nounish experiences being available on where Coinbase will be driving users.","1) Funds delegated to the Pod are considered to belong to Nouns, and revenue generated from merchandise sales will be reinvested into producing larger merch quantities for the foreseeable future.

To find character and story via a large group effort or to come up with a formula or system to follow may be making things too complex, I would find very challenging. <:boney_meg:905865244998529085> I personally prefer a single voice / vision or work with one writing partner ( I can only write with Sun-Min, I'e given up working well with others )  when it comes to finding the relatable character in a grounded existence I can relate to, and a meaningful journey of growth, no matter if the theme is zany ( Rick Morty ) or simple Pre school like peppa. <:MEG_MIND_BLOWN:899712201303162890>  My own personal take favors first efforts being perhaps animatics ( even in still slide show form ) with voice, rough sound, so we can get a feel for the direction, voice, conceit and who the characters are/ what their relationships are ( and do we believe it ), what do they love, etc. Very rough choppy requiring no real expense other than ones time... those are usually enough to give us a clear picture, as so much is going to be in the execution ( timing, delivery ) and above all else, is this a relatable character with real problems or their own grounded believable reality we can't swipe any other character out for. <:UMA_STRIDE:848183822099939328>",

The timer part isn't technically required but is implemented to be 6s after the block notification appears. There are also some HTTP API calls made to get the Nouns Auction House state. You can send votes via the voting websocket, and it will return the vote tallies, score, etc. to display in the UI. If sufficient votes are received, it'll launch settlement entirely on the backend.

Our group of writers (members from teams 1 and 2) will be available to speak at the event, and we would love to bring other writers from Prop 70 on stage.

There will be press there, and with a strong Nouns presence as the only CC0 project in the space, its a chance to leverage all that's happening in Film3 and really put a Nounish spin on it.

1. They agree with the idea of having summary reports and sharable press release links with pictures of completed projects. They are working on improving the display and distribution of information related to funded projects.

2. The success stories can be found in the provided Notion link: https://www.notion.so/noun22/Nouns-DAO-Small-Grants-ac22114a6c004bafa500e2d824e32dc3. Some funded projects include jingles, nouns athletes, functional glasses, newsletters, luxury glasses, video games, and FOMO Nouns.

3. Many of the projects are still in progress, so it's too early to call any of them a failure at this stage.

Regarding the remaining work of our first prop, our deadlines are the end of July for the website translation and mid-August for the posters raid.

We understand it is rushed to ask for a new grant when we have an ongoing prop. We did it because of the timing of the event and our belief that this is a great opportunity to grow our community",

The ideal approach would be to take the USD total cost and do the conversion rate at the time of funding."

It will be digital with potential to produce physical sets. It just so happened to bring the prototype with me on my little excursion to Mexico. When I came across Nouns I got fucking hyped and pulled out ol√© faithful.

I still need to finish the SDS, but almost everything is already laid out in my noggin. 

I am having a hard time connecting it with the noun esthetic, BUTTT the purpose of the game is use real world scenarios to teach people the basic personal finance and investment skills that school just so happened to bypass. I am hoping with this game I could help people free themselves from the cyclic path of financial struggle. To me that's pretty dang nounish.

Would love to collab with some others to help me with the coding and final design.

What chall think?",It is suggested that the financial literacy board game idea could be more centric to Nouns or at least NFTs to better align with the Nouns DAO's goals. One possibility is to include Noun characters as an option or have a Nounish loading screen.

I shared this idea in <#855538581434007635>, and I think there‚Äôs something there but it‚Äôs still rough. I‚Äôd love to flesh it out further and create a prototype to help validate the concept. That feels like something that‚Äôs more work than what might be covered in a 2 eth prop house round, but less than a 25 eth combinator round or an on-chain proposal. 

Is Small Grants the right venue for something like this?","Small Grants could be the right venue for your idea, as it seems to fall between the scope of a 2 ETH prop house round and a 25 ETH combinator round or an on-chain proposal.

Are there any objections to airdropping POAPs? Airdrops have become somewhat controversial, but solve the awareness and trigger problem I‚Äôve described.

**Nounish Beings R1 Updates**

- David has taken a first pass at a large run of unique options for Nounish Beings. You can view those attached below. We would love your feedback, notes, any initial thoughts you have. So share away!
- With those notes, David will then work on adjusting the Nounish Beings to fit within the constraints of the POAP system's file requirements.

**Bidder User Journey**
**Trigger**
The Trigger function in the user journey is where we have a few questions we'd like to propose to the Nouns Community in order to gather a preferred consensus. There are two ways to go about the trigger/receiving process with the end result of holding the Bidder POAP. View those below:
        
1. You can use the microsite to claim your own POAP and go through the poap.xyz ecosystem through our microsite. 
       
 2. We can claim the POAP for the Bidder ""Winners"" and have the POAP sent to them within the poap.xyz ecosystem. If we were to go this route, we would end up creating a microsite that is more of a playground for people to explore what this POAP and the Nounish Beings are all about. Think, more information on Nouns, David, the proliferation of the community, fun features to explore different POAPs etc. 
 
Beyond those two options for the trigger/receipt function, we have a larger question for the Nouns Community. Read below:

- In order to bring awareness to this microsite and the ability to claim, for free a Nouns Bidder POAP, would the DAO be open to allowing the addition of a link within the main nav or footer that would then send people to our microsite to be able to let bidders know they have this free gift that they get to claim? And also allow people just explore and learn more while waiting for auctions to end, etc.
 
----------------------------  
 We would love any and all thoughts on the initial question of the trigger as well as thoughts on the proposition of an additional link on the site for the POAP function.

1. Are you insinuating bids 6 through n can claim? I think there were some strong objections to this during the proposal phase because it would be easy to exploit.

2. Once a POAP is airdropped, would there be a need to claim again? We don‚Äôt have plans to allow multiple POAPs to be claimed by one wallet.

Also, the challenge with the current state of Web3 wallets is there isn‚Äôt a way to send notifications. The convenience of airdropping bypasses the need to notify.","The question was whether bids 6 through n can claim POAPs and if there would be a need to claim again once a POAP is airdropped. The answers provided in the direct reply are:

1. The initial idea was for the top 10 bidders (top 5 = airdrop, 6-10 = claim), but after revisiting the proposal, it was agreed to restrict it to the top 5 bidders.

Once you‚Äôre not manually adding poap winners, would it be possible to allow all bidders to get a poap, not just top 5? The reason for this is that it allows anyone to be feel connected to Nouns and get something Noun related. I imagine the top 5 will be 10+ETH bids so only whales will be able to get poaps. Whales are already being rewarded by battling it out and getting a Noun. For non-whales there‚Äôs still a barrier to entry with gas prices being high so it still requires a commitment to bid and be poap‚Äôed",

I think there‚Äôs a strategic decision to be made by NounsDAO with regard to treasury management:

A. ETH-only 
B. staked ETH - a low-risk, conservative and passive strategy
C. DeFi yield generation - actively managed yield generation 

I would argue in favour of A or B given the early stage NounsDAO is at. This could be a decision that we take for the next 365 days and revisit it annually. 

Let me explain the reasoning. As much as I love yield generation, and hate to see the treasury ETH ‚Äújust sitting there‚Äù I think we should be mindful about where we direct our attention and efforts. 

What we should consciously avoid at this stage is ‚Äúincrementalism‚Äù in our thinking and this is exactly where strategy C will lead us. Should we get 5% more here or there? Is that farm 20% safer or riskier? Every new person joining will have their own theory about yield generation. None of them will materially move the needle. 

By deciding that for the next 365 days we decide *NOT* to have any yield generation discussions (outside of staking ETH) we focus ourselves on core 10x innovations NounsDAO is uniquely positioned to introduce. Yield management is not one of them. 

Just a quick pulse check on what other think of it. Which strategy should we focus on for the next 365 days?","Based on the conversation, the question about which treasury management strategy NounsDAO should focus on for the next 365 days was not directly answered. However, there were opinions shared in favor of staking ETH (option B) and some discussions about other potential investments like BTC, NFTs, and ERC-20 tokens. It is suggested that a small and elite committee could be formed to make recommendations on financial strategies for the organization."

Most noun owners know how to grow wealth, that is how they got to afford a noun. Most noun owners could certainly be (and probably are) putting their personal treasuries to work via yield earning. 

What is the appeal of nounsdao? What is the UVP of being a member and investing capital here as opposed to elsewhere?

I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs that you can pool your ETH together to participate in the same yield generation activities that you already can on your own‚Ä¶ The opportunity here is the model created where the feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns, driving value to the NFTs, bootstrapping community and all the good stuff that spending the ETH in novel and experimental ways can bring.

Is attention/focus/time the scarcest commodity in crypto? And are some of nouns greatest assets the brains, experience, and connections of the nouners themselves? 

My fear is that every minute nouners spend thinking and debating traditional treasury management measures like yield generation is time not spent engaging in the unique opportunity this project presents us, and therefore kind of‚Ä¶ a waste. Could be done elsewhere, way more efficiently, where attention is not so split and votes aren‚Äôt required and it doesn‚Äôt have to be balanced out with the greater vision which is facing a different direction.","The appeal of NounsDAO is the unique opportunity it presents for its members to pool their resources and invest in novel and experimental ways that drive value to the NFTs, bootstrap community, and create a feedback loop of spending on proliferating nouns.

decisions we expect will require more deliberation:

1. which token do we want to pay in? e.g. USDC vs DAI 
2. the amount of the baseline position the DAO will hold, denominated in USD (the baseline amount helps pay builders immediately, vs asking builders to wait until we can buy USD on chain)
2.1 with this decision the DAO can set lower and upper bounds within which an admin multisig can adjust things without going through the proposal process

---

decisions we expect should be easier to decide on:

1. the max price slippage rate; this should be easy as the DAO can set a reasonable upper bound and let the admin multisig find an optimal value gradually on mainnet
2. who should be the admin; personally I think the tech pod multisig is a great choice with highly relevant people already part of that team (to clarify: the highest owner role is of course the DAO's; the admin has more limited configuration rights)

for anyone curious about the state of the code right now: https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/pull/1","Based on the conversation, the key decisions regarding the stablecoin payments infrastructure are as follows:

1. The majority of users seem to prefer DAI over USDC, but they want to ensure there's an easy and low-cost path for builders to convert and withdraw their funds.
