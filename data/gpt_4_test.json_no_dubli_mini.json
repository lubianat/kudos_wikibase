In less than one month, we\u2019ve built a delegate platform for voters to broadcast what they want to see, and for builders to find voters who might support their prop. To illustrate the outcome with some numbers, so far we\u2019ve seen:\\n\\n* 17 statements from delegates representing 125 nouns (>25% of all votes!)\\n* 16 statements from builders who are seeking delegation\\n* 5 nouns delegated via Agora (that we know of)\\n* Proposal passed to [deploy a beta](https://lil-nouns-agora-dev.act.workers.dev/) on lil nouns\\n\\nIn sum, Agora has created a hub that turned delegation from an invisible, behind the scenes activity, to something the community can see, participate in, discuss, and improve upon.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nOur goal has always been to greatly improve the effectiveness of the Nouns DAO. We recognize that while the DAO lives and dies by the quality of its decision making, the time demand of being a good voter is such that we cannot expect most token holders to participate to the degree required. Therefore focusing on driving delegation of votes into the hands of qualified and engaged delegates is the highest leverage activity we can invest in \u2013 especially given that",

Therefore focusing on driving delegation of votes into the hands of qualified and engaged delegates is the highest leverage activity we can invest in \u2013 especially given that constant issuance means that delegation and governance engagement is naturally trending downwards.\\n\\nAlthough creating a client like Agora to reduce friction and provide transparency is a necessary first step, we don\u2019t think that alone will be enough to drive meaningful delegation. That\u2019s why the next phase of Agora will not only continue to improve the delegation client, but also deliberately invest in programs and mechanisms that can greatly increase delegation and participation. We outline below the key areas we\u2019ll focus on in the next phase of Agora.\\n\\n## Focus areas\\n\\n**Incentivize effective governance:** We believe there\u2019s tremendous potential in creating incentives to reward effective governance, but also recognize the pitfalls of designing poor mechanisms. As such, we will be running a series of small scale incentive programs over the next months, with the goal of finding the best one to turn into a mechanism we can invest in for the long run. Below are some examples of incentive designs.\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n\\nWe\u2019d like to seek funding for a quarter (3 months) to keep developing",
